@article{Chen2011ab,
abstract = {Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray has great potential for its applications in both diagnosis and treatment of diseases, due to its characteristic properties including coherence, collimation, monochromaticity, and exceptional brightness. Great advances have been made regarding potential medical applications of SR X-ray in recent years, particularly with the development of the third generation of SR light sources. However, multiple studies have also suggested damaging effects of SR X-ray on biological samples ranging from protein crystals to cells and biological tissues. It has become increasingly important to conduct comprehensive studies on two closely related topics regarding SR X-ray in medical applications: The safety issues regarding the medical applications of SR X-ray and the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between SR X-ray and biological tissues. In this article, we attempted to provide an overview of the literatures regarding these two increasingly significant topics. We also proposed our hypothesis that there are significant differences between the biological tissue-damaging mechanisms of SR X-ray and those of normal X-ray, due to the characteristic properties of SR X-ray such as high dose rate. Future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis, which may profoundly improve our understanding regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between light and matter. These studies would also constitute an essential basis for establishing the safety standard for the medical applications of SR X-ray.},

abstract = {A significant improvement over conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging, which lacks contrast in small objects and soft biological tissues, is obtained by introducing phase-contrast imaging. As recently demonstrated, phase-contrast imaging is characterized by its extraordinary image quality, greatly enhanced contrast, and good soft tissue discrimination with very high spatial resolution down to the micron and even the sub-micron region. The rapid development of compact X-ray sources of high brightness, tuneability, and monochromaticity as well as high-resolution X-ray detectors with high quantum efficiency and improved computational methods is stimulating the development of a new generation of X-ray imaging systems for medical applications. The present paper reviews some intrinsic mechanisms, recent technical developments and potential medical applications of two-, three- and four-dimensional phase-contrast X-ray imaging. Challenging issues in current phase-contrast imaging techniques and key clinical applications are discussed and possible developments of future high-contrast and high spatial and temporal resolution medical X-ray imaging systems are outlined.},

abstract = {In early stages of various pulmonary diseases, such as emphysema and fibrosis, the change in X-ray attenuation is not detectable with absorption-based radiography. To monitor the morphological changes that the alveoli network undergoes in the progression of these diseases, we propose using the dark-field signal, which is related to small-angle scattering in the sample. Combined with the absorption-based image, the dark-field signal enables better discrimination between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue in a mouse model. All measurements have been performed at 36 keV using a monochromatic laser-driven miniature synchrotron X-ray source (Compact Light Source). In this paper we present grating-based dark-field images of emphysematous vs. healthy lung tissue, where the strong dependence of the dark-field signal on mean alveolar size leads to improved diagnosis of emphysema in lung radiographs.},

Strict separation between artifacts and original features allowing both, suppression of the unwanted structures and high degree of preservation of the original image information is endeavoured. The results are validated by visual assessments, as well as by quantitative estimation of the image energy loss. The capabilities and the performance of the filter are tested on a number of case studies related to applications in tomographic imaging. The case studies include (i) suppression of waterfall artifacts in electron microscopy images based on focussed ion beam nanotomography, (ii) removal of different types of ring artifacts in synchrotron based X-ray microtomography and (iii) suppression of horizontal stripe artifacts from phase projections in grating interferometry.},

@article{Grass2000,
abstract = {3D reconstruction from 2D projections obtained along a single circular source trajectory is most commonly done using an algorithm due to Feldkamp, Davis and Kress. In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on a cone-beam to parallel-beam rebinning step, a corresponding rebinning step into a rectangular virtual detector plane and a filtered backprojection. This approach yields an improved image quality reflected by a decreased low-intensity drop which is well known for 3D reconstruction from projection data obtained along circular trajectories. At the same time the computational complexity is lower than in Feldkamp's original approach. Based on this idea, a hybrid 3D cone-beam reconstruction method is formulated that enlarges the reconstruction volume in its dimension along the rotation axis of the cone-beam CT system. This enlargement is achieved by applying different reconstruction conditions for each voxel. An optimal ratio between the reconstructible and irradiated volume of the scanned object is achieved.},

So far the method was mainly restricted to X-ray energies below 40 keV, which is too low to examine dense or thick objects, but a routine operation at higher energies is on the brink of realisation. In this study, imaging results obtained at 82 keV are presented. These comprise a test object consisting of well-defined materials for a quantitative analysis and a tooth to translate the findings to a biomedical sample. Measured linear attenuation coefficients ? and electron densities ?e are in good agreement with theoretical values. Improved contrast-to-noise ratios were found in phase contrast compared to attenuation contrast. The combination of both contrast modalities further enables to simultaneously assess information on density and composition of materials with effective atomic numbers Z? > 8. In our biomedical example, we demonstrate the possibility to detect differences in mass density and calcium concentration within teeth.},

@article{Lundstrom2012a,
abstract = {X-ray in-line phase contrast has recently been combined with CO(2) angiography for high-resolution small-animal vascular imaging at low radiation dose. In this paper we further investigate the potential and limitations of this method and demonstrate observation of vessels down to 8 $\mu$m in diameter, considerably smaller than the 60 $\mu$m previously reported. Our in-line phase-contrast imaging system is based on a liquid-metal-jet-anode x-ray source and utilizes free-space propagation to convert phase shifts, caused by refractive index variations, into intensity differences. Enhanced refractive index variations are obtained through injection of CO(2) gas into the vascular system to replace the blood. We show rat-kidney images with blood vessels down to 27 $\mu$m in diameter and mouse-ear images with vessels down to 8 $\mu$m. The minimum size of observable blood vessels is found to be limited by the penetration of gas into the vascular system and the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. the allowed dose. The diameters of vessels being gas-filled depend on the gas pressure and follow a simple model based on surface tension. A theoretical signal-to-noise comparison shows that this method requires 1000 times less radiation dose than conventional iodine-based absorption contrast for observing sub-50 $\mu$m vessels.},

@article{Engelhardt2008,
abstract = {The influence of different physical parameters, such as the source size and the energy spectrum, on the functional capability of a grating interferometer applied for phase-contrast imaging is discussed using numerical simulations based on Fresnel diffraction theory. The presented simulation results explain why the interferometer could be well combined with polychromatic laboratory x-ray sources in recent experiments. Furthermore, it is shown that the distance between the two gratings of the interferometer is not in general limited by the width of the photon energy spectrum. This implies that interferometers that give a further improved image quality for phase measurements can be designed, because the primary measurement signal for phase measurements can be increased by enlargement of this distance. Finally, the mathematical background and practical instructions for the quantitative evaluation of measurement data acquired with a polychromatic x-ray source are given.},

abstract = {B-splines are attractive basis functions for the continuous-domain representation of biomedical images and volumes. In this paper, we prove that the extended family of box splines are closed under the Radon transform and derive explicit formulae for their transforms. Our results are general; they cover all known brands of compactly-supported box splines (tensor-product B-splines, separable or not) in any number of dimensions. The proposed box spline approach extends to non-Cartesian lattices used for discretizing the image space. In particular, we prove that the 2-D Radon transform of an N-direction box spline is generally a (nonuniform) polynomial spline of degree N-1. The proposed framework allows for a proper discretization of a variety of tomographic reconstruction problems in a box spline basis. It is of relevance for imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. We provide experimental results that demonstrate the practical advantages of the box spline formulation for improving the quality and efficiency of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.},

@article{Hubbell1999,
abstract = {The probability of a photon (x-ray, gamma-ray, bremsstrahlung, etc) of a given energy E undergoing absorption or scattering when traversing a layer of material Z can be expressed quantitatively in terms of a linear attenuation coefficient mu (cm(-1)). Since mu is dependent on the material's density, rho (g cm(-3)), which can be variable, the quantity usually tabulated is the mass attenuation coefficient mu/rho (cm2 g(-1)) in which the dependence on the density has been removed. Mu/rho, in turn, can be obtained as the sum of the different types of possible interactions of photons with atoms of the material. For photon energies below 1 MeV the major interaction processes to be considered are incoherent (Compton) scattering, coherent (Rayleigh) scattering and atomic photoeffect absorption. Above 1 MeV one must also include nuclear-field pair production and atomic-field (triplet) production, and above 5 MeV one in principle should include photonuclear absorption, although the latter is neglected in data tabulations up to the present time. This review includes a selective history of measurements and theory relating to mu/rho from the turn of the century up to the present time, and is intended to provide a basis for further calculations and critical tabulations of photon cross section data, particularly as required by users in radiation medicine and biology. The mass energy-absorption coefficient mu(en)/rho is also briefly discussed.},

@article{Stampanoni2011,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: Phase-contrast and scattering-based x-ray imaging are known to provide additional and complementary information to conventional, absorption-based methods, and therefore have the potential to play a crucial role in medical diagnostics. We report on the first mammographic investigation of 5 native, that is, freshly dissected, breasts carried out with a grating interferometer and a conventional x-ray tube source. Four patients in this study had histopathologically proven invasive breast cancer. One male patient, without the presence of any malignant formations within the resected breast, was included as a control specimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We used a Talbot-Lau grating setup installed on a conventional, low-brilliance x-ray source; the interferometer operated at the fifth Talbot distance, at a tube voltage of 40 kVp with mean energy of 28 keV, and at a current of 25 mA. The device simultaneously recorded absorption, differential phase and small-angle scattering signals from the native breast tissue. These quantities were then combined into novel color- and high-frequency-enhanced radiographic images. Presurgical images (conventional mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging) supported the findings and clinical relevance was verified. RESULTS:: Our approach yields complementary and otherwise inaccessible information on the electron density distribution and the small-angle scattering power of the sample at the microscopic scale. This information can be used to potentially answer clinically relevant, yet unresolved questions such as unequivocally discerning between malignant and premalignant changes and postoperative scars and distinguishing cancer-invaded regions within healthy tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: We present the first ex vivo images of fresh, native breast tissue obtained from mastectomy specimens using grating interferometry. This technique yields improved diagnostic capabilities when compared with conventional mammography, especially when discerning the type of malignant conversions and their breadth within normal breast tissue. These promising results advance us toward the ultimate goal, using grating interferometry in vivo on humans in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) are two popular microscopy techniques that have evolved quite independently. CDI promises to reach resolutions below 10 nanometers, but the reconstruction procedures put stringent requirements on data quality and sample preparation. In contrast, STXM features straightforward data analysis, but its resolution is limited by the spot size on the specimen. We demonstrate a ptychographic imaging method that bridges the gap between CDI and STXM by measuring complete diffraction patterns at each point of a STXM scan. The high penetration power of x-rays in combination with the high spatial resolution will allow investigation of a wide range of complex mesoscopic life and material science specimens, such as embedded semiconductor devices or cellular networks.},

abstract = {Coherent X-ray scattering is related to the electron density distribution by a Fourier transform, and therefore a window into the microscopic structures of biological samples. Current techniques of scattering rely on small-angle measurements from highly collimated X-ray beams produced from synchrotron light sources. Imaging of the distribution of scattering provides a new contrast mechanism which is different from absorption radiography, but is a lengthy process of raster or line scans of the beam over the object. Here, we describe an imaging technique in the spatial frequency domain capable of acquiring both the scattering and absorption distributions in a single exposure. We present first results obtained with conventional X-ray equipment. This method interposes a grid between the X-ray source and the imaged object, so that the grid-modulated image contains a primary image and a grid harmonic image. The ratio between the harmonic and primary images is shown to be a pure scattering image. It is the auto-correlation of the electron density distribution at a specific distance. We tested a number of samples at 60-200 nm autocorrelation distance, and found the scattering images to be distinct from the absorption images and reveal new features. This technique is simple to implement, and should help broaden the imaging applications of X-ray scattering.},

abstract = {We present a high-brightness 24-keV electron-impact microfocus x-ray source based on continuous operation of a heated liquid-indium/gallium-jet anode. The 30-70 W electron beam is magnetically focused onto the jet, producing a circular 7-13 $\mu$m full width half maximum x-ray spot. The measured spectral brightness at the 24.2 keV In K($\alpha$) line is 3 × 10(9) photons∕(s × mm(2) × mrad(2) × 0.1\% BW) at 30 W electron-beam power. The high photon energy compared to existing liquid-metal-jet sources increases the penetration depth and allows imaging of thicker samples. The applicability of the source in the biomedical field is demonstrated by high-resolution imaging of a mammography phantom and a phase-contrast angiography phantom.},

abstract = {In x-ray radiography, particularly for technical and industrial applications, a scanning setup is very often favorable when compared to a direct two-dimensional image acquisition. Here, we report on an efficient scanning method for grating based x-ray phase contrast imaging with tube based sources. It uses multiple line detectors for staggered acquisition of the individual phase-stepping images. We find that the total exposure time does not exceed the time needed in an equivalent scanning setup for absorption radiography. Therefore, we conclude that it should be possible to implement the method into a scanning system without affecting the scanning speed or significant increase in cost but with the advantage of providing both the phase contrast and the absorption information at once.},

abstract = {Iterative reconstruction algorithms are becoming increasingly important in electron tomography of biological samples. These algorithms, however, impose major computational demands. Parallelization must be employed to maintain acceptable running times. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been demonstrated to be highly cost-effective for carrying out these computations with a high degree of parallelism. In a recent paper by Xu et al. (2010), a GPU implementation strategy was presented that obtains a speedup of an order of magnitude over a previously proposed GPU-based electron tomography implementation. In this technical note, we demonstrate that by making alternative design decisions in the GPU implementation, an additional speedup can be obtained, again of an order of magnitude. By carefully considering memory access locality when dividing the workload among blocks of threads, the GPU's cache is used more efficiently, making more effective use of the available memory bandwidth.},

@article{Donath2010a,
abstract = {Objectives: X-ray computed tomography (CT) using phase contrast can provide images with greatly enhanced soft-tissue contrast in comparison to conventional attenuation-based CT. We report on the first scan of a human specimen recorded with a phase-contrast CT system based on an x-ray grating interferometer and a conventional x-ray tube source. Feasibility and potential applications of preclinical and clinical phase-contrast CT are discussed. Materials and Methods: A hand of an infant was scanned ex vivo at 40 kVp tube voltage. The simultaneously recorded attenuation and phase-contrast CT images were quantitatively compared with each other, by introducing a specific Hounsfield unit for phase-contrast imaging. Results: We observe significantly enhanced soft-tissue contrast in the phase images, when compared with the attenuation data. Particularly, tendons and ligaments appear with strongly increased contrast-to-noise ratio. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the huge potential of phase-contrast CT for clinical investigations of human specimens and, potentially, of humans. Because the applied technique works efficiently with conventional x-ray tubes and detectors, it is suitable for the realization of preclinical and clinical phase-contrast CT systems.},

@article{Khelashvili2006,
abstract = {We recently proposed a phase-sensitive x-ray imaging method called multiple-image radiography (MIR), which is an improvement on the diffraction-enhanced imaging technique. MIR simultaneously produces three images, depicting separately the effects of absorption, refraction and ultra-small-angle scattering of x-rays, and all three MIR images are virtually immune to degradation caused by scattering at higher angles. Although good results have been obtained using MIR, no quantitative model of the imaging process has yet been developed. In this paper, we present a theoretical prediction of the MIR image values in terms of fundamental physical properties of the object being imaged. We use radiative transport theory to model the beam propagation, and we model the object as a stratified medium containing discrete scattering particles. An important finding of our analysis is that the image values in all three MIR images are line integrals of various object parameters, which is an essential property for computed tomography to be achieved with conventional reconstruction methods. Our analysis also shows that MIR truly separates the effects of absorption, refraction and ultra-small-angle scattering for the case considered. We validate our analytical model using real and simulated imaging data.},

For quantitative analysis of these images, the phase needs to be retrieved numerically. There are many phase-retrieval methods available. Those suitable for phase-contrast tomography, i.e., non-iterative phase-retrieval methods that use only one image at each projection angle, all follow the same pattern though derived in different ways. We outline this pattern and use it to compare the methods to each other, considering only phase-retrieval performance and not the additional effects of tomographic reconstruction. We also outline derivations, approximations and assumptions, and show which methods are similar or identical and how they relate to each other. A simple scheme for choosing reconstruction method is presented, and numerical phase-retrieval performed for all methods.},

@article{Tapfer2013,
abstract = {To explore the potential of grating-based x-ray phase-contrast computed tomography (CT) for preclinical research, a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was investigated. One ex-vivo mouse specimen was scanned with different grating-based phase-contrast CT imaging setups covering two different settings: i) high-resolution synchrotron radiation (SR) imaging and ii) dose-reduced imaging using either synchrotron radiation or a conventional x-ray tube source. These experimental settings were chosen to assess the potential of phase-contrast imaging for two different types of application: i) high-performance imaging for virtual microscopy applications and ii) biomedical imaging with increased soft-tissue contrast for in-vivo applications. For validation and as a reference, histological slicing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed on the same mouse specimen. For each x-ray imaging setup, attenuation and phase-contrast images were compared visually with regard to contrast in general, and specifically concerning the recognizability of lesions and cancerous tissue. To quantitatively assess contrast, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of selected regions of interest (ROI) in the attenuation images and the phase images were analyzed and compared. It was found that both for virtual microscopy and for in-vivo applications, there is great potential for phase-contrast imaging: in the SR-based benchmarking data, fine details about tissue composition are accessible in the phase images and the visibility of solid tumor tissue under dose-reduced conditions is markedly superior in the phase images. The present study hence demonstrates improved diagnostic value with phase-contrast CT in a mouse model of a complex endogenous cancer, promoting the use and further development of grating-based phase-contrast CT for biomedical imaging applications.},

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how grating based phase-contrast CT can provide contrast superior to standard absorption based CT. The method of phase-contrast CT is applied to two samples of porcine subcutaneous fat and rind. The additional contrast obtained may be used for quality testing, to investigate variations in fatty acid composition of the fat-fraction, and density variations in the meat-fraction. The possibility of integrating the method into an abattoir environment is discussed.},

@article{Long2010,
abstract = {Iterative methods for 3D image reconstruction have the potential to improve image quality over conventional filtered back projection (FBP) in X-ray computed tomography (CT). However, the computation burden of 3D cone-beam forward and back-projectors is one of the greatest challenges facing practical adoption of iterative methods for X-ray CT. Moreover, projector accuracy is also important for iterative methods. This paper describes two new separable footprint (SF) projector methods that approximate the voxel footprint functions as 2D separable functions. Because of the separability of these footprint functions, calculating their integrals over a detector cell is greatly simplified and can be implemented efficiently. The SF-TR projector uses trapezoid functions in the transaxial direction and rectangular functions in the axial direction, whereas the SF-TT projector uses trapezoid functions in both directions. Simulations and experiments showed that both SF projector methods are more accurate than the distance-driven (DD) projector, which is a current state-of-the-art method in the field. The SF-TT projector is more accurate than the SF-TR projector for rays associated with large cone angles. The SF-TR projector has similar computation speed with the DD projector and the SF-TT projector is about two times slower.},

In this article a numerical framework is developed that allows for a realistic and quantitative determination of the sensitivity. The framework is validated by comparisons with experimental results and then used for the quantification of several influences on the sensitivity, such as spatial coherence or the number of phase step images. In particular, we identify the ideal inter-grating distance with respect to the highest sensitivity for parallel beam geometry. This knowledge will help to optimize existing synchrotron-based grating interferometry setups.},

abstract = {Phase-contrast imaging at laboratory-based x-ray sources using grating interferometers has been developed over the last few years for x-ray energies of up to 28 keV. Here, we show first phase-contrast projection and tomographic images recorded at significantly higher x-ray energies, produced by an x-ray tube source operated at 100 kV acceleration voltage. We find our measured tomographic phase images in good agreement with tabulated data. The extension of phase-contrast imaging to this significantly higher x-ray energy opens up many applications of the technique in medicine and industrial nondestructive testing.},

abstract = {Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) can provide information on mean size, predominant orientation and typical shape of mineral crystals in bone. In this paper, recent developments of this technique for application in bone research are reviewed. Then the structure of the collagen/mineral composite in bone, as determined by SAXS, is compared for a number of species. The thickness of the mineral crystals was found to increase with age up to a value around 3 to 4 nanometers in adult animals, depending on the species. The SAXS results also suggest the existence of needle-shaped mineral crystals in mouse or rat bone and more plate-shaped crystals in other tissues like adult human bone or mineralized turkey leg tendon.},

abstract = {X-ray imaging is of paramount importance for clinical and preclinical imaging but it is fundamentally restricted by the attenuation-based contrast mechanism, which has remained essentially the same since Roentgen's discovery a century ago. Recently, based on the Talbot effect, groundbreaking work was reported using 1D gratings for X-ray phase-contrast imaging with a hospital-grade X-ray tube instead of a synchrotron or microfocused source. In this paper, we report an extension using 2D gratings that reduces the imaging time and increases the accuracy and robustness of phase retrieval compared to current grating-based phase-contrast techniques. Feasibility is demonstrated via numerical simulation.},

In particular, we observe that the brain tumor and the white and gray brain matter structure in a rat's cerebellum are clearly resolved. The results are potentially interesting from a clinical point of view, since a similar approach using three transmission gratings can be implemented with more readily available x-ray sources, such as standard x-ray tubes. Moreover, the results open the way to in vivo experiments in the near future.},

abstract = {Digital radiography offers the potential of improved image quality as well as providing opportunities for advances in medical image management, computer-aided diagnosis and teleradiology. Image quality is intimately linked to the precise and accurate acquisition of information from the x-ray beam transmitted by the patient, i.e. to the performance of the x-ray detector. Detectors for digital radiography must meet the needs of the specific radiological procedure where they will be used. Key parameters are spatial resolution, uniformity of response, contrast sensitivity, dynamic range, acquisition speed and frame rate. The underlying physical considerations defining the performance of x-ray detectors for radiography will be reviewed. Some of the more promising existing and experimental detector technologies which may be suitable for digital radiography will be considered. Devices that can be employed in full-area detectors and also those more appropriate for scanning x-ray systems will be discussed. These include various approaches based on phosphor x-ray converters, where light quanta are produced as an intermediate stage, as well as direct x-ray-to-charge conversion materials such as zinc cadmium telluride, amorphous selenium and crystalline silicon.},

@article{Bauhs2008,
abstract = {In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the most common parameter used to estimate and minimize patient dose is the CT dose index (CTDI). The CTDI is a volume-averaged measure that is used in situations where the table is incremented in conjunction with the tube rotation. Variants of the CTDI correct for averaging across the field of view and for adjacent beam overlaps or gaps. CTDI is usually measured with a pencil-shaped ionization chamber, although methods have been developed that use alternative detectors, including an optically stimulated luminescence probe and a solid-state real-time dosimeter. Because the CTDI represents an averaged dose to a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, the measurements are only an approximation of the patient dose. Furthermore, dose from interventional or perfusion CT, in which the table remains stationary between multiple scans, is best evaluated with point dose measurements made with small detectors. CTDI and point dose values are nearly the same for measurement of surface dose from spiral CT. However, for measurement of surface dose from perfusion CT, the dose is overestimated by a factor of two or more with CTDI values in comparison with point dose values. Both CTDI and point dose measurement are valuable for evaluating CT scanner output and estimating patient dose.},

SpekCalc was designed primarily for use in a medical physics context, for both research and education purposes, but may also be of interest to those working with x-ray tubes in industry. Noteworthy is the particularly wide range of tube potentials (40-300 kVp) and anode angles (recommended: 6-30 degrees) that can be modelled: the program is therefore potentially of use to those working in superficial/orthovoltage radiotherapy, as well as diagnostic radiology. The utility is free to download and is based on a deterministic model of x-ray spectrum generation (Poludniowski 2007 Med. Phys. 34 2175). Filtration can be applied for seven materials (air, water, Be, Al, Cu, Sn and W). In this note SpekCalc is described and illustrative examples are shown. Predictions are compared to those of a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo code (BEAMnrc) and, where possible, to an alternative, widely-used, spectrum calculation program (IPEM78).},

We performed the experiments at 19 keV x-ray energy and 0.8 $\mu$m pixel resolution. The small grating period resulted in clear separation of different diffraction orders and multiple images on the detector. A slitted beam was used to remove overlap of the images from the different diffraction orders. The phase contrast images showed detailed features as small as 10 $\mu$m, and demonstrated the feasibility of high resolution x-ray phase contrast imaging with nanometer scale gratings.},

In the following work, we report on the recent development of quantitative descriptions for the stochastic error of grating-based differential phase contrast imaging (DPCi). Our model includes the noise transfer characteristics of the x-ray detector and the jitter of the phase steps. We find that the noise in DPCi depends strongly on the phase stepping visibility and the sample properties. The results are supported by experimental evidence acquired with our new instrument with a field of view of 50x70 mm(2). Our conclusions provide general guidelines to optimize grating interferometers for specific applications and problems.},

abstract = {To explore the future clinical potential of improved soft-tissue visibility with grating-based X-ray phase contrast (PC), we have developed a first preclinical computed tomography (CT) scanner featuring a rotating gantry. The main challenge in the transition from previous bench-top systems to a preclinical scanner are phase artifacts that are caused by minimal changes in the grating alignment during gantry rotation. In this paper, we present the first experimental results from the system together with an adaptive phase recovery method that corrects for these phase artifacts. Using this method, we show that the scanner can recover quantitatively accurate Hounsfield units in attenuation and phase. Moreover, we present a first tomography scan of biological tissue with complementary information in attenuation and phase contrast. The present study hence demonstrates the feasibility of grating-based phase contrast with a rotating gantry for the first time and paves the way for future in vivo studies on small animal disease models (in the mid-term future) and human diagnostics applications (in the long-term future).},

abstract = {Imaging with visible light today uses numerous contrast mechanisms, including bright- and dark-field contrast, phase-contrast schemes and confocal and fluorescence-based methods. X-ray imaging, on the other hand, has only recently seen the development of an analogous variety of contrast modalities. Although X-ray phase-contrast imaging could successfully be implemented at a relatively early stage with several techniques, dark-field imaging, or more generally scattering-based imaging, with hard X-rays and good signal-to-noise ratio, in practice still remains a challenging task even at highly brilliant synchrotron sources. In this letter, we report a new approach on the basis of a grating interferometer that can efficiently yield dark-field scatter images of high quality, even with conventional X-ray tube sources. Because the image contrast is formed through the mechanism of small-angle scattering, it provides complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometre and submicrometre length scale. Our approach is fully compatible with conventional transmission radiography and a recently developed hard-X-ray phase-contrast imaging scheme. Applications to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing and security screening are discussed.},

@article{Sidky2008,
abstract = {An iterative algorithm, based on recent work in compressive sensing, is developed for volume image reconstruction from a circular cone-beam scan. The algorithm minimizes the total variation (TV) of the image subject to the constraint that the estimated projection data is within a specified tolerance of the available data and that the values of the volume image are non-negative. The constraints are enforced by the use of projection onto convex sets (POCS) and the TV objective is minimized by steepest descent with an adaptive step-size. The algorithm is referred to as adaptive-steepest-descent-POCS (ASD-POCS). It appears to be robust against cone-beam artifacts, and may be particularly useful when the angular range is limited or when the angular sampling rate is low. The ASD-POCS algorithm is tested with the Defrise disk and jaw computerized phantoms. Some comparisons are performed with the POCS and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Although the algorithm is presented in the context of circular cone-beam image reconstruction, it can also be applied to scanning geometries involving other x-ray source trajectories.},

@article{Ruegsegger1996,
abstract = {Microtomography (micro-computed-tomography, mu-CT) is a method to image and quantify trabecular bone. It has the capability to address the role of trabecular architecture on the mechanical properties of bone and to study trabecular bone remodeling. The system described in this work is based on a compact fan-beam type tomograph that can work in spiral scanning or multislice mode. An X-ray tube with a microfocus is used as a source, a CCD-array as a detector. Samples with diameters from a few millimeters to a maximum of 14 mm can be measured, typically, bone biopsies with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of approximately 10 mm are measured. Spatial resolution is 28 microns. Usually the volume of interest contains 4 x 4 x 4 mm3 and is represented in 14 x 14 x 14 microns3 voxels. 3D stereological indices are extracted according to the standard definitions used in histomorphometry. Triangular surface representation is effected with an extended marching cube algorithm and forms a convenient basis for finite element analysis. Microtomographic measurements may be employed to "calibrate" lower-dose, lower-resolution images in vivo as well as to nondestructively assess unprocessed surgical bone biopsy specimens. These specimens remain intact for mechanical or histological testing.},

@article{Tapfer2011,
abstract = {Purpose: To explore the potential of grating-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging for clinical applications, a first compact gantry system was developed. It is designed such that it can be implemented into an in-vivo small-animal phase-contrast computed tomography (PC-CT) scanner. The purpose of the present study is to assess the accuracy and quantitativeness of the described gantry in both absorption and phase-contrast.Methods: A phantom, containing six chemically well-defined liquids, was constructed. A tomography scan with cone-beam reconstruction of this phantom was performed yielding the spatial distribution of the linear attenuation coefficient $\mu$ and decrement $\delta$ of the complex refractive index. Theoretical values of $\mu$ and $\delta$ were calculated for each liquid from tabulated data and compared with the experimentally measured values. Additionally, a color-fused image representation is proposed to display the complementary absorption and phase-contrast information in a single image.Results: Experimental and calculated data of the phantom agree well confirming the quantitativeness and accuracy of the reconstructed spatial distributions of $\mu$ and $\delta$. The proposed color-fused image representation, which combines the complementary absorption and phase information, considerably helps in distinguishing the individual substances.Conclusions: The concept of grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography (CT) can be implemented into a compact, cone-beam geometry gantry setup. The authors believe that this work represents an important milestone in translating phase-contrast x-ray imaging from previous proof-of-principle experiments to first preclinical biomedical imaging applications on small-animal models.},

abstract = {We have studied the size and orientation of mineral crystals in cortical bone of oim/oim mice, which are known to produce only alpha 1(I) collagen homotrimers and which may serve as a model for human osteogenesis imperfecta. Long bones (femur and tibia) from young (5 wk old) oim/oim mice and from unaffected heterozygous counterparts were investigated by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), which is sensitive to structures smaller than 50 nm. Mineral crystals were compared in terms of their thickness and their alignment with respect to the long bone axis. While electron microscopic tomography has recently shown the existence of large mineral blocks (with all dimensions typically exceeding 50 nm) in mineralized tendons of oim/oim mice, SAXS revealed a family of thin, possibly needle-like, crystals in cortical bone. These crystals were similar in shape to those observed previously in normal mice, but they were thinner and less well aligned in oim/oim mice relative to heterozygotes. Moreover, the crystal thickness and their alignment with the bone axis were more variable in oim/oim bone, with a close correlation (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) between the two parameters. The presence of smaller crystals with more variable alignment in corticalis of oim/oim mice may contribute to the brittleness of their bone, similar to that of human osteogenesis imperfecta.},

@article{Potdevin2012,
abstract = {The understanding of large biophysical systems at the systems level often depends on a precise knowledge of their microstructure. This is difficult to obtain, especially in vivo, because most imaging methods are either limited in terms of achievable field of view, or make use of penetrating ionizing radiations such as x-rays, in which case the resolution is severely limited by the deposited dose. Here, we describe a new method, x-ray vector radiography (XVR), which yields various types of information about the local orientation, anisotropy and average size of the sample microstructures. We demonstrate the feasibility by showing first experimental XVRs of human vertebra bone samples, giving information on the trabecular structures even with a pixel resolution of half a millimetre, much larger than the structures themselves. This last point is critical for the development of low-dose measurement methods which will allow for in vivo studies and potentially in the future for new medical diagnostics methods of bone metabolic disorder diseases such as osteoporosis.},

@article{Dierolf2010,
abstract = {X-ray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging. It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research. Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify. Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging. As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.},

@article{Stutman2011a,
abstract = {A high-resolution radiographic method for soft tissues in the small joints of the hand would aid in the study and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), which often attacks these joints. Of particular interest would be imaging with <100 µm resolution the joint cartilage, whose integrity is a main indicator of disease. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) or refraction-based x-ray imaging with Talbot grating interferometers could provide such a method, since it enhances soft tissue contrast and can be implemented with conventional x-ray tubes. A numerical joint phantom was first developed to assess the angular sensitivity and spectrum needed for a hand DPC system. The model predicts that, due to quite similar refraction indexes for joint soft tissues, the refraction effects are very small, requiring high angular resolution. To compare our model to experiment we built a high-resolution bench-top interferometer using 10 µm period gratings, a W anode tube and a CCD-based detector. Imaging experiments on animal cartilage and on a human finger support the model predictions. For instance, the estimated difference between the index of refraction of cartilage and water is of only several percent at ∼25 keV mean energy, comparable to that between the linear attenuation coefficients. The potential advantage of DPC imaging thus comes mainly from the edge enhancement at the soft tissue interfaces. Experiments using a cadaveric human finger are also qualitatively consistent with the joint model, showing that refraction contrast is dominated by tendon embedded in muscle, with the cartilage layer difficult to observe in our conditions. Nevertheless, the model predicts that a DPC radiographic system for the small hand joints of the hand could be feasible using a low energy quasi-monochromatic source, such as a K-edge filtered Rh or Mo tube, in conjunction with a ∼2 m long 'symmetric' interferometer operated in a high Talbot order.},

@article{Zanette2012a,
abstract = {X-ray grating interferometry is a coherent imaging technique that bears tremendous potential for three-dimensional tomographic imaging of soft biological tissue and other specimens whose details exhibit very weak absorption contrast. It is intrinsically trimodal, delivering phase contrast, absorption contrast, and scattering ("dark-field") contrast. Recently reported acquisition strategies for grating-interferometric phase tomography constitute a major improvement of dose efficiency and speed. In particular, some of these techniques eliminate the need for scanning of one of the gratings ("phase stepping"). This advantage, however, comes at the cost of other limitations. These can be a loss in spatial resolution, or the inability to fully separate the three imaging modalities. In the present paper we report a data acquisition and processing method that optimizes dose efficiency but does not share the main limitations of other recently reported methods. Although our method still relies on phase stepping, it effectively uses only down to a single detector frame per projection angle and yields images corresponding to all three contrast modalities. In particular, this means that dark-field imaging remains accessible. The method is also compliant with data acquisition over an angular range of only 180° and with a continuous rotation of the specimen.},

abstract = {Scanning X-ray microprobes are unique tools for the nanoscale investigation of specimens from the life, environmental, materials and other fields of sciences. Typically they utilize absorption and fluorescence as contrast mechanisms. Phase contrast is a complementary technique that can provide strong contrast with reduced radiation dose for weakly absorbing structures in the multi-keV range. In this paper the development of a segmented charge-integrating silicon detector which provides simultaneous absorption and differential phase contrast is reported. The detector can be used together with a fluorescence detector for the simultaneous acquisition of transmission and fluorescence data. It can be used over a wide range of photon energies, photon rates and exposure times at third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, and is currently operating at two beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source. Images obtained at around 2 keV and 10 keV demonstrate the superiority of phase contrast over absorption for specimens composed of light elements.},

abstract = {A method for the magnification of x-ray radiographic images is described and demonstrated. This magnifier employs two successive asymmetric diffractions of an x-ray beam from highly perfect silicon crystals. The two diffractions magnify the beam in two perpendicular directions. A device with a magnification of 25x is demonstrated for Cu K(alpha) radiation. This device preserves and sometimes improves the resolution inherent in the radiographic technique. The x-ray magnifier is particularly useful in circumventing the relatively poor spatial resolution of electro-optical imaging systems needed for real-time observations. Basic limits on magnification and resolution using this method are described.},

@article{Gureyev2000,
abstract = {A new method for extracting quantitative information from phase-contrast x-ray images obtained with microfocus x-ray sources is presented. The proposed technique allows rapid noninvasive characterization of the internal structure of thick optically opaque organic samples. The method does not generally involve any sample preparation and does not need any x-ray optical elements (such as monochromators, zone plates, or interferometers). As a consequence, samples can be imaged in vivo or in vitro, and the images are free from optical aberrations. While alternative techniques of x-ray phase-contrast imaging usually require expensive synchrotron radiation sources, our method can be implemented with conventional, albeit microfocus, x-ray tubes, which greatly enhances its practicality. In the present work, we develop the theoretical framework, perform numerical simulations, and present the first experimental results, demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach. We believe that this method should find wide-ranging applications in clinical radiology and medical research.},

@article{Guigay2004,
abstract = {The Talbot effect is the self-imaging, at distances D multiple of D(R), of the intensity downstream of a periodic object. Earlier work with hard synchrotron radiation X-rays showed the variation with D of the fundamental Fourier component of intensity to be a good measurement of beam coherence. Any higher-order Fourier coefficients I (D, m > 1) would be periodic with a reduced period D(Rm) = D(R)/m for an ideally coherent incident beam (partial Talbot effect). The degree of coherence gamma(x) is sampled through the ratio of I (D, m) at D = 0 and multiples of D(Rm). This requires the Fourier coefficient for D = 0, which is not accessible for a phase object (no contrast at D = 0). However, the ratio of the slopes of I (D, m) at D = 0 and D = pD(Rm) also provides this information. Furthermore, a characterization of gamma(x) is possible, provided an assumption is made on its shape, using only the ratio of the Fourier coefficient I (D, m) of two images a distance pD(Rm) apart. Experiments with one- and two-dimensional phase gratings and a mixed (amplitude and phase) two-dimensional grating confirm that the partial Talbot effect approach is viable. It requires a reduced range of distances, and yields important results directly, obviating the need for computer fits. In particular, 8\% of the beam intensity was found to have very low coherence in the vertical direction, probably due to monochromator imperfection.},

abstract = {Recently, x-ray differential phase contrast computed tomography (DPC-CT) has been experimentally implemented using a conventional tube combined with gratings. Images were reconstructed using a parallel-beam reconstruction formula. However, parallel-beam reconstruction formulae are not applicable when the parallel-beam approximation fails. In this paper, we present a new image reconstruction formula for fan-beam DPC-CT. There are several novel features of the new image reconstruction formula: (i) when the scanning angular range of data acquisition is larger than pi + gamma(m) (gamma(m) is the full fan angle), the entire field of view can be exactly reconstructed; (ii) when the scanning angular range is smaller than pi + gamma(m), a local region of interest (ROI) can be exactly reconstructed; (iii) it enables an exact reconstruction for a local ROI when the projection data are truncated at some view angles; (iv) it enlarges the imaging field of view when the detector is asymmetrically placed. In this last case, the data are truncated from every view angle. Numerical simulations have been conducted to validate the new reconstruction formula.},

abstract = {We describe a new method for the direct examination of three-dimensional bone structure in vitro based on high-resolution computed tomography (CT). Unlike clinical CT, a three-dimensional reconstruction array is created directly, rather than a series of two-dimensional slices. All structural indices commonly determined from two-dimensional histologic sections can be obtained nondestructively from a large number of slices in each of three orthogonal directions. This permits a comprehensive description of structural variation within a specimen and greatly facilitates the study of structural anisotropy. A measure of three-dimensional connectivity (Euler number/tissue volume) has been determined for the first time in human cancellous bone and shown to correlate with several two-dimensional histomorphometric indices. The method has the potential for overcoming many of the limitations of current approaches to the study of bone architecture at the microscopic level.},

abstract = {We assesses the efficiency of x-ray Talbot interferometry (XTI), a technique based on the Talbot effect for measuring a wavefront gradient, in terms of how quickly it can capture a high-quality phase image with a large signal-to-noise ratio for a given incident photon number. Photon statistics cause errors in the phase of the moir\'{e} fringes and impose a detection limit on the wavefront gradient. The relation between the incident photon number and the detection limit is determined, and a figure of merit of XTI for a monochromatic cone beam is then defined. The dependence of the figure of merit on optical system parameters, such as grating pitch and position, is then discussed. The effects of varying the pattern height and linewidth of the second grating are shown for rectangular and trapezoidal teeth. Finally, we show how to design a practical cone-beam Talbot interferometer for certain boundary conditions.},

The small transverse size of the luminous region yields a highly coherent beam with an angular divergence of a few milliradians. The intrinsic monochromaticity and coherence of the produced X-rays can be exploited in high-sensitivity differential phase-contrast imaging with a grating-based interferometer. Here, the first multimodal X-ray imaging experiments at the Compact Light Sourbibce at a clinically compatible X-ray energy of 21 keV are reported. Dose-compatible measurements of a mammography phantom clearly demonstrate an increase in contrast attainable through differential phase and dark-field imaging over conventional attenuation-based projections.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a laboratory method for imaging small blood vessels using x-ray propagation-based phase-contrast imaging and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) gas as a contrast agent. The limited radiation dose in combination with CO(2) being clinically acceptable makes the method promising for small-diameter vascular visualization. We investigate the possibilities and limitations of the method for small-animal angiography and compare it with conventional absorption-based x-ray angiography. Photon noise in absorption-contrast imaging prevents visualization of blood vessels narrower than 50 µm at the highest radiation doses compatible with living animals, whereas our simulations and experiments indicate the possibility of visualizing 20 µm vessels at radiation doses as low as 100 mGy. Experimental computed tomography of excised rat kidney shows blood vessels of diameters down to 60 µm with improved image quality compared to absorption-based methods. With our present prototype x-ray source, the acquisition time for a tomographic dataset is approximately 1 h, which is long compared to the 1-20 min common for absorption-contrast micro-CT systems. Further development of the liquid-metal-jet microfocus x-ray sources used here and high-resolution x-ray detectors shows promise to reduce exposure times and make this high-resolution method practical for imaging of living animals.},

@article{Kohler2001,
abstract = {Sequential cone-beam tomography is a method that uses data of two or more parallel circular trajectories of a cone-beam scanner to reconstruct the object function. We propose a condition for the data acquisition that ensures that all object points between two successive circles are irradiated over an angular span of the x-ray source position of exactly 360 degrees in total as seen along the rotation axis. A fast and efficient approximative reconstruction method for the proposed acquisition is presented which uses data from exactly 360 degrees for every object point. It is based on the Tent-FDK method which was recently developed for single circular cone-beam CT. The measurement geometry does not provide sufficient data for exact reconstruction but it is shown that the proposed reconstruction method provides satisfying image quality for small cone angles.},

The bright spots of the amplitude image are to be used for illuminating the array of microdevices of a digital optical computer.},

@article{Joseph1982,
abstract = {It is often desired to calculate line integrals through a field of reconstructed CT density pixels for the purpose of improving CT image quality. Two algorithms widely published and discussed in the past are known to either degrade spatial resolution or generate errors in the results due to the discontinuous "square pixel" modeling of the reconstructed image. An algorithm is described, based on linear interpolation between pixels, which provides superior accuracy without unnecessary loss of resolution. It was tested on simulated data for a head section and on a narrow Gaussian density distribution. The experimental results demonstrated improved performance. The method is expected to prove useful for many types of post-reconstruction processing, including beam hardening, missing data, and noise supression algorithms.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {The goal of this paper was to investigate the benefits that could be realistically achieved on a microCT imaging system with an energy-resolved photon-counting x-ray detector. To this end, we built and evaluated a prototype microCT system based on such a detector. The detector is based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) radiation sensors and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) readouts. Each detector pixel can simultaneously count x-ray photons above six energy thresholds, providing the capability for energy-selective x-ray imaging. We tested the spectroscopic performance of the system using polychromatic x-ray radiation and various filtering materials with Kabsorption edges. Tomographic images were then acquired of a cylindrical PMMA phantom containing holes filled with various materials. Results were also compared with those acquired using an intensity-integrating x-ray detector and single-energy (i.e. non-energy-selective) CT. This paper describes the functionality and performance of the system, and presents preliminary spectroscopic and tomographic results. The spectroscopic experiments showed that the energy- resolved photon-counting detector was capable of measuring energy spectra from polychromatic sources like a standard x-ray tube, and resolving absorption edges present in the energy range used for imaging. However, the spectral quality was degraded by spectral distortions resulting from degrading factors, including finite energy resolution and charge sharing. We developed a simple charge-sharing model to reproduce these distortions. The tomographic experiments showed that the availability of multiple energy thresholds in the photon-counting detector allowed us to simultaneously measure target-to-background contrasts in different energy ranges. Compared with single-energy CT with an integrating detector, this feature was especially useful to improve differentiation of materials with different attenuation coefficient energy dependences.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

@article{McDonald2009,
abstract = {Phase-sensitive X-ray imaging methods can provide substantially increased contrast over conventional absorption-based imaging, and therefore new and otherwise inaccessible information. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) imaging, which uses a grating interferometer and a phase-stepping technique, has been integrated into TOMCAT, a beamline dedicated to tomographic microscopy and coherent radiology experiments at the Swiss Light Source. Developments have been made focusing on the fast acquisition and post-processing of data to enable a high-throughput of samples, with obvious advantages, also through increasing the efficiency of the detecting system, of helping to reduce radiation dose imparted to the sample. A novel aquarium design allows a vertical rotation axis below the sample with measurements performed in aqueous environment. Optimization of the data acquisition procedure enables a full phase volume (1024 x 1024 pixels x 1000 projections x 9 phase steps, i.e. 9000 projections in total) to be acquired in 20 min (with a pixel size of 7.4 microm), and the subsequent post-processing has been integrated into the beamline pipeline for sinogram generation. Local DPC tomography allows one to focus with higher magnification on a particular region of interest of a sample without the presence of local tomography reconstruction artifacts. Furthermore, 'widefield' imaging is shown for DPC scans for the first time, enabling the field of view of the imaging system to be doubled for samples that are larger than the magnification allows. A case study is illustrated focusing on the visualization of soft tissue features, and particularly the substantia nigra of a rat brain. Darkfield images, based on local X-ray scattering, can also be extracted from a grating-based DPC scan: an example of the advantages of darkfield contrast is shown and the potential of darkfield X-ray tomography is discussed.},

abstract = {The influence of polychromaticity of the X-ray source on the performance of an X-ray Talbot interferometer applied for phase-contrast imaging is analyzed through numerical simulations based on the Fresnel diffraction theory. The presented simulation results show that the visibility of the self-image is fairly insensitive to the source polychromaticity and explain why the interferometer could be well combined with polychromatic X-ray sources in recent experiments. Furthermore, the self-image with a high visibility can be obtained under polychromatic illumination even at a high-order fractional Talbot distance. This fact implies that the acquired image quality for phase measurements can be improved, since the primary signal for phase measurement is proportional to the inter-grating distance. Finally, we mention that the results are also valid for Talbot-Lau interferometer and scanning double-grating configuration.},

abstract = {A simulation model of mammographic x-ray sources with finite size has been developed. The model is based on Monte Carlo methods and it takes into account the electron penetration inside the anode, the anode geometry and material, as well as the resulting heel effect and the spectral and spatial distribution of x-rays. This x-ray source simulation model has been embedded into an earlier developed simulation package of a mammography unit. The main outputs of this model are Monte Carlo generated images that correspond to the irradiation of properly designed phantoms. In this way it is possible to make studies of the influence of x-ray source characteristics on MTF. This paper presents the development of the mammographic x-ray source model, accompanied by a set of simulation studies concerning the influence of magnification effects as well as that of the x-ray spatial and spectral distribution on the mammographic spatial resolution for a certain magnification factor (m = 1.4). The validity level of the model, as well as its limitations and perspectives, rise through comparisons with experimental and theoretical data.},

@article{Weich2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The critical analysis of baseline factors has been found to be useful to predict virologic nonresponse (NR), relapse, or sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who receive antiviral therapy. In the present retrospective study we tried to find out whether gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) may be one of the baseline factors which are of special predictive power. We analyzed, in patients with different treatment outcomes, the predictive power of established baseline factors either in combination with GGT or by evaluating the predictive value of GGT independently. METHODS: Individual data from 632 patients chronically infected with HCV type 1 (n = 561) or type 2/3 (n = 71) were analyzed. All patients had received their first course of antiviral therapy and were treated with pegylated interferon $\alpha$-2a or -2b plus ribavirin. RESULTS: In patients with HCV type 1, a multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis identified low GGT (p < 0.0001), high cholesterol (p < 0.0001), age ≤40 years (p < 0.0001), high alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.0006), low viremia (p = 0.0014), and absence of cirrhosis (p = 0.0164) as independent predictors. While these baseline factors heralded improved virologic response, high GGT, in contrast, was significantly associated with NR (p < 0.0001). A strong correlation was found between log(10) GGT and a scoring variable S (r = -0.26 for prediction of SVR, p < 0.001; r = 0.11 for prediction of NR, p = 0.016) summarizing predictive information from other baseline factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings prove the predictive sensitivity of GGT as an independent indicator of nonresponsiveness even at levels that are slightly above the normal range. This new predictive parameter may help to improve individualized therapy in HCV type-1 infection.},

@article{Pinzer2012,
abstract = {One of the core pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Current efforts of medical imaging research aim at visualizing amyloid plaques in living patients in order to evaluate the progression of the pathology, but also to facilitate the diagnosis of AD at the prodromal stage. In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of a new experimental imaging setup to image amyloid plaques in the brain of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. This imaging setup relies on a grating interferometer at a synchrotron X-ray source to measure the differential phase contrast between brain tissue and amyloid plaques. It provides high-resolution images with a large field of view, making it possible to scan an entire mouse brain. Here, we showed that this setup yields sufficient contrast to detect amyloid plaques and to quantify automatically several important structural parameters, such as their size and their regional density in 3D, on the scale of a whole mouse brain. Whilst future developments are required to apply this technique in vivo, this grating-based setup already gives the possibility to perform powerful studies aiming at quantifying the amyloid pathology in mouse models of AD and might accelerate the evaluation of anti-amyloid compounds. In addition, this technique may also facilitate the development of other amyloid imaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) by providing convenient high-resolution 3D data of the plaque distribution for multimodal comparison.},

@article{Biggs1997,
abstract = {A new technique for the acceleration of iterative image restoration algorithms is proposed. The method is based on the principles of vector extrapolation and does not require the minimization of a cost function. The algorithm is derived and its performance illustrated with Richardson-Lucy (R-L) and maximum entropy (ME) deconvolution algorithms and the Gerchberg-Saxton magnitude and phase retrieval algorithms. Considerable reduction in restoration times is achieved with little image distortion or computational overhead per iteration. The speedup achieved is shown to increase with the number of iterations performed and is easily adapted to suit different algorithms. An example R-L restoration achieves an average speedup of 40 times after 250 iterations and an ME method 20 times after only 50 iterations. An expression for estimating the acceleration factor is derived and confirmed experimentally. Comparisons with other acceleration techniques in the literature reveal significant improvements in speed and stability.},

In order to reduce the residual absorption artifact (due to the fact that only one data set is used) the original algorithm presented by A. V. Bronnikov is amended by adding in the filter a factor found by using a semi empirical approach. The quality of the reconstruction is largely sufficient for optimal segmentation and further postprocessing even though the filter correction is based on assumption of constant absorption. This one step approach allows keeping radiation dose to the minimum. Spatial resolution is comparable to the conventional absorption based technique. The performance of the method is validated by using an established phase contrast technique.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the possibility of computing quantitatively accurate images of mass density variations in soft tissue. This is a challenging task, because density variations in soft tissue, such as the breast, can be very subtle. Beginning from an image of refraction angle created by either diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI) or multiple-image radiography (MIR), we estimate the mass-density image using a constrained least squares (CLS) method. The CLS algorithm yields accurate density estimates while effectively suppressing noise. Our method improves on an analytical method proposed by Hasnah et al (2005 Med. Phys. 32 549-52), which can produce significant artefacts when even a modest level of noise is present. We present a quantitative evaluation study to determine the accuracy with which mass density can be determined in the presence of noise. Based on computer simulations, we find that the mass-density estimation error can be as low as a few per cent for typical density variations found in the breast. Example images computed from less-noisy real data are also shown to illustrate the feasibility of the technique. We anticipate that density imaging may have application in assessment of water content of cartilage resulting from osteoarthritis, in evaluation of bone density, and in mammographic interpretation.},

abstract = {X-ray differential phase contrast imaging methods, including projection imaging and the corresponding computed tomography (CT), have been implemented using a Talbot interferometer and either a synchrotron beam line or a low brilliance x-ray source generated by a stationary-anode x-ray tube. From small-angle scattering events which occur as an x-ray propagates through a medium, a signal intensity loss can be recorded and analyzed for an understanding of the micro-structures in an image object. This has been demonstrated using a Talbot-Lau interferometer and a stationary-anode x-ray tube. In this paper, theoretical principles and an experimental implementation of the corresponding CT imaging method are presented. First, a line integral is derived from analyzing the cross section of the small-angle scattering events. This method is referred to as small-angle scattering computed tomography (SAS-CT). Next, a Talbot-Lau interferometer and a rotating-anode x-ray tube were used to implement SAS-CT. A physical phantom and human breast tissue sample were used to demonstrate the reconstructed SAS-CT image volumes.},

abstract = {Phase retrieval from unidirectional radiographic differential phase contrast images requires integration of noisy data. A method is presented, which aims to suppress stripe artifacts arising from direct image integration. It is purely algorithmic and therefore, compared to alternative approaches, neither additional alignment nor an increased scan time is required. We report on the theory of this method and present results using numerical as well as experimental data. The method shows significant improvements on the phase retrieval accuracy and enhances contrast in the phase image. Due to its general applicability, the proposed method provides a valuable tool for various 2D imaging applications using differential data.},

The proposed approach eliminates the need to scan the gratings, thus allowing for a faster CT acquisition compared to methods presently in use. The contrast in the reconstructed images can be expressed as a linear combination of the absorption and refraction within the sample. Experimental images of a test phantom made of known materials and a human bone-cartilage sample prove the correctness of the method and show very good agreement with the theory. The here proposed approach might be highly interesting in many fields where a reduced imaging acquisition time is requested and/or where the radiation dose delivered to the sample has to be kept low, such as, for example, in in-vivo imaging.},

The ability to acquire the desired information within a single exposure is important for dynamic samples, as is sufficient sensitivity to reveal small variations in the composition or thickness of such a sample. This approach satisfies both these needs by analyzing how a reference grid pattern is deformed by the presence of the sample, similar to a Shack-Hartmann sensor. By resolving the shift of the pattern into horizontal and vertical components, a quantitative phase depth map is recovered, sensitive to both sharp edges as well as low phase gradients.},

Our preliminary results demonstrate that the sparsity constraint helps effectively improve the quality of reconstructed images and reduce the number of necessary projections.},

@article{Bauhs2008,
abstract = {In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the most common parameter used to estimate and minimize patient dose is the CT dose index (CTDI). The CTDI is a volume-averaged measure that is used in situations where the table is incremented in conjunction with the tube rotation. Variants of the CTDI correct for averaging across the field of view and for adjacent beam overlaps or gaps. CTDI is usually measured with a pencil-shaped ionization chamber, although methods have been developed that use alternative detectors, including an optically stimulated luminescence probe and a solid-state real-time dosimeter. Because the CTDI represents an averaged dose to a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, the measurements are only an approximation of the patient dose. Furthermore, dose from interventional or perfusion CT, in which the table remains stationary between multiple scans, is best evaluated with point dose measurements made with small detectors. CTDI and point dose values are nearly the same for measurement of surface dose from spiral CT. However, for measurement of surface dose from perfusion CT, the dose is overestimated by a factor of two or more with CTDI values in comparison with point dose values. Both CTDI and point dose measurement are valuable for evaluating CT scanner output and estimating patient dose.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstract = {The global prevalence of dementia is estimated to be as high as 24 million, and is predicted to double every 20 years through to 2040, leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, which typically begins with deterioration in memory. Before death, individuals with this disorder have usually become dependent on caregivers. The neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques-which are frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites-and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies are often accompanied by the presence of reactive microgliosis and the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying the neuropathological changes in AD remain unclear, but are probably affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we provide an overview of the criteria used in the diagnosis of AD, highlighting how this disease is related to, but distinct from, normal aging. We also summarize current information relating to AD prevalence, incidence and risk factors, and review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis.},

This work focuses on grating-based differential phase-contrast imaging. A mathematical framework is derived that is able to analytically predict the relative performance of both imaging techniques in the sense of the relative contrast-to-noise ratio for the contrast of any two materials. Two fundamentally different properties of PCT compared with CT are identified. First, the noise power spectra show qualitatively different characteristics implying a resolution-dependent performance ratio. The break-even point is derived analytically as a function of system parameters such as geometry and visibility. A superior performance of PCT compared with CT can only be achieved at a sufficiently high spatial resolution. Second, due to periodicity of phase information which is non-ambiguous only in a bounded interval statistical phase wrapping can occur. This effect causes a collapse of information propagation for low signals which limits the applicability of phase-contrast imaging at low dose.},

@article{Mader2012,
abstract = {Wood, trabecular bone, coral, liquid foams, grains in polycrystals, igneous rock, and even many types of food share many structural similarities and belong to the general class called cellular materials. The visualization of these materials in 3D has been made possible in the last decades through a variety of imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed X-ray tomography ($\mu$CT), and confocal microscopy. Recent advances in synchrotron-based ultra fast tomography have enabled measurements in liquid foams with thousands of bubbles and time resolutions down to 0.5 seconds. Post-processing techniques have, however, not kept pace and extracting useful physical metrics from such measurements is far from trivial. In this manuscript we present and validate a new, fully-automated method for segmenting and labeling the void space in cellular materials where the walls between cells are not visible or present. The individual cell labeling is based on a new tool, the Gradient Guided Watershed, which, while computationally simple, can be robustly scaled to large data-sets. Specifically we demonstrate the utility of this new method on several liquid foams (with varying liquid fraction and polydispersity) composed of thousands of bubbles, and the subsequent quantitative 3D structural characterization of those foams.},

abstract = {Our understanding of early development in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clouded by the scale at which the disease progresses; amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, a hallmark feature of AD, are small (approximately 50 microm) and low contrast in diagnostic clinical imaging techniques. Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), a phase contrast x-ray imaging technique, has greater soft tissue contrast than conventional radiography and generates higher resolution images than magnetic resonance microimaging. Thus, in this proof of principle study, DEI in micro-CT mode was performed on the brains of AD-model mice to determine if DEI can visualize Abeta plaques. Results revealed small nodules in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. Histology confirmed that the features seen in the DEI images of the brain were Abeta plaques. Several anatomical structures, including hippocampal subregions and white matter tracks, were also observed. Thus, DEI has strong promise in early diagnosis of AD, as well as general studies of the mouse brain.},

abstract = {The measurement of the linear attenuation coefficients of breast tissues is of fundamental importance in the field of breast x-ray diagnostic imaging. Different groups have evaluated the linear attenuation coefficients of breast tissues by carrying out direct attenuation measurements in which the specimens were thin and selected as homogeneous as possible. Here, we use monochromatic and high-intensity synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SR CT) to evaluate the linear attenuation coefficients of surgical breast tissues in the energy range from 15 to 26.5 keV. X-ray detection is performed by a custom digital silicon micro-strip device, developed in the framework of the PICASSO INFN experiment. Twenty-three human surgical breast samples were selected for SR CT and histological study. Six of them underwent CT, both as fresh tissue and after formalin fixation, while the remaining 17 were imaged only as formalin-fixed tissues. Our results for fat and fibrous tissues are in good agreement with the published values. However, in contrast to the published data, our measurements show no significant differences between fibrous and tumor tissues. Moreover, our results for fresh and formalin-fixed tissues demonstrate a reduction of the linear attenuation coefficient for fibrous and tumor tissues after fixation.},

The technique is capable of recording the phase shift of hard X-rays travelling through a sample, which greatly enhances the contrast of low absorbing specimen compared to conventional amplitude contrast images. Unlike other existing X-ray phase contrast imaging methods, the grating interferometer also works with incoherent radiation from a standard X-ray tube. The key components are three gratings with silicon and gold structures, which have dimensions in the micrometer range and high aspect ratios. The fabrication processes, which involve photolithography, anisotropic wet etching, and electroplating, are described in this article for each of the three gratings. An example of an X-ray phase contrast image acquired with the grating interferometer is given.},

Non-irradiated sucrose solutions are optically "empty" in the visible and near UV range. After gamma irradiation an absorption band with a maximum at 263 nm appears. It was confirmed that this band can be used as dosimetric signal for the dose range: 1-10 kGy. The species responsible for the 263 nm band is a neutral product of sucrose oxidation by an OH radical. High energy electron irradiation creates another UV absorbing species with the absorption band peaked at 270 nm. Further investigations are necessary to establish to what extent it can be used for electron beam dosimetry.},

Photon statistics cause errors in the phase of the moir\'{e} fringes and impose a detection limit on the wavefront gradient. The relation between the incident photon number and the detection limit is determined, and a figure of merit of XTI for a monochromatic cone beam is then defined. The dependence of the figure of merit on optical system parameters, such as grating pitch and position, is then discussed. The effects of varying the pattern height and linewidth of the second grating are shown for rectangular and trapezoidal teeth. Finally, we show how to design a practical cone-beam Talbot interferometer for certain boundary conditions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The US government spends more than \$200 million annually on abstinence-promotion programs, including virginity pledges. This study compares the sexual activity of adolescent virginity pledgers with matched nonpledgers by using more robust methods than past research. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects for this study were National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health respondents, a nationally representative sample of middle and high school students who, when surveyed in 1995, had never had sex or taken a virginity pledge and who were >15 years of age (n = 3440). Adolescents who reported taking a virginity pledge on the 1996 survey (n = 289) were matched with nonpledgers (n = 645) by using exact and nearest-neighbor matching within propensity score calipers on factors including prepledge religiosity and attitudes toward sex and birth control. Pledgers and matched nonpledgers were compared 5 years after the pledge on self-reported sexual behaviors and positive test results for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, and safe sex outside of marriage by use of birth control and condoms in the past year and at last sex. RESULTS: Five years after the pledge, 82\% of pledgers denied having ever pledged. Pledgers and matched nonpledgers did not differ in premarital sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and anal and oral sex variables. Pledgers had 0.1 fewer past-year partners but did not differ in lifetime sexual partners and age of first sex. Fewer pledgers than matched nonpledgers used birth control and condoms in the past year and birth control at last sex. CONCLUSIONS: The sexual behavior of virginity pledgers does not differ from that of closely matched nonpledgers, and pledgers are less likely to protect themselves from pregnancy and disease before marriage. Virginity pledges may not affect sexual behavior but may decrease the likelihood of taking precautions during sex. Clinicians should provide birth control information to all adolescents, especially virginity pledgers.},

abstract = {Prenatal heart valve interventions aiming at the early and systematic correction of congenital cardiac malformations represent a promising treatment option in maternal-fetal care. However, definite fetal valve replacements require growing implants adaptive to fetal and postnatal development. The presented study investigates the fetal implantation of prenatally engineered living autologous cell-based heart valves. Autologous amniotic fluid cells (AFCs) were isolated from pregnant sheep between 122 and 128 days of gestation via transuterine sonographic sampling. Stented trileaflet heart valves were fabricated from biodegradable PGA-P4HB composite matrices (n = 9) and seeded with AFCs in vitro. Within the same intervention, tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs) and unseeded controls were implanted orthotopically into the pulmonary position using an in-utero closed-heart hybrid approach. The transapical valve deployments were successful in all animals with acute survival of 77.8\% of fetuses. TEHV in-vivo functionality was assessed using echocardiography as well as angiography. Fetuses were harvested up to 1 week after implantation representing a birth-relevant gestational age.

@article{Stutman2011,
abstract = {A high-resolution radiographic method for soft tissues in the small joints of the hand would aid in the study and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), which often attacks these joints. Of particular interest would be imaging with <100 µm resolution the joint cartilage, whose integrity is a main indicator of disease. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) or refraction-based x-ray imaging with Talbot grating interferometers could provide such a method, since it enhances soft tissue contrast and can be implemented with conventional x-ray tubes. A numerical joint phantom was first developed to assess the angular sensitivity and spectrum needed for a hand DPC system. The model predicts that, due to quite similar refraction indexes for joint soft tissues, the refraction effects are very small, requiring high angular resolution. To compare our model to experiment we built a high-resolution bench-top interferometer using 10 µm period gratings, a W anode tube and a CCD-based detector. Imaging experiments on animal cartilage and on a human finger support the model predictions. For instance, the estimated difference between the index of refraction of cartilage and water is of only several percent at ∼25 keV mean energy, comparable to that between the linear attenuation coefficients. The potential advantage of DPC imaging thus comes mainly from the edge enhancement at the soft tissue interfaces. Experiments using a cadaveric human finger are also qualitatively consistent with the joint model, showing that refraction contrast is dominated by tendon embedded in muscle, with the cartilage layer difficult to observe in our conditions. Nevertheless, the model predicts that a DPC radiographic system for the small hand joints of the hand could be feasible using a low energy quasi-monochromatic source, such as a K-edge filtered Rh or Mo tube, in conjunction with a ∼2 m long 'symmetric' interferometer operated in a high Talbot order.},

abstract = {Ice cream is a complex multiphase system consisting of ice crystals, air cells and fat globules embedded in a high viscous freeze concentrated matrix phase. The microstructure of these constituents has significant impact on the consumer quality characteristics and its specific manipulation is of great interest. While in the frozen state the structure is dominated by the ice crystals after thawing the foam characteristics become important. Ice cream foam stability is correlated to the sensed creaminess and can be improved with smaller air cells and reduced coalescence. In contrast to the common approach addressing this goal by changed recipes this contribution proposes an additional process step which allows efficient dispersion of the air cells by high shear forces. Disruption of air cells by shear is efficiently done at high matrix viscosities, which are directly related to the amount of frozen water and therefore the temperature. Conventionally scraped surface heat exchangers (freezers) are used for whipping and freezing of an ice cream premix. With outlet temperature of -5 to -8 C these devices operate at relatively low ice cream viscosities. Here the ice cream is processed in a low temperature extruder \{(LTE)\} after a classic freezer which cools it further to below -12 degrees C. This way shear forces exceeding those in the conventional system by 2-3 orders of magnitude can he applied, The maximum air cell diameter x(90.3) is reduced from 52 to 19 mu m. Beside the air structures the extrusion process induces also changes in the fat structures. High shear forces are also able to form an optimized network of agglomerated fat globules, which further stabilize.,, the foam, These structural changes have a significant impact on the foam related quality characteristics of ice cream its is proven by measurements, of the rheological behaviour during thawing and melt down tests.

Unfortunately, severe reconstruction artifacts appear in the presence of differential phase wrapping and clipping. In this paper, we propose to use the attenuation contrast, which is obtained from the same measurement, for correcting the DPC signal. Using the example of a DPC CT measurement with pronounced phase artifacts, we will discuss the efficiency of our phase artifact correction method.},

@article{Bauhs2008,
abstract = {In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the most common parameter used to estimate and minimize patient dose is the CT dose index (CTDI). The CTDI is a volume-averaged measure that is used in situations where the table is incremented in conjunction with the tube rotation. Variants of the CTDI correct for averaging across the field of view and for adjacent beam overlaps or gaps. CTDI is usually measured with a pencil-shaped ionization chamber, although methods have been developed that use alternative detectors, including an optically stimulated luminescence probe and a solid-state real-time dosimeter. Because the CTDI represents an averaged dose to a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, the measurements are only an approximation of the patient dose. Furthermore, dose from interventional or perfusion CT, in which the table remains stationary between multiple scans, is best evaluated with point dose measurements made with small detectors. CTDI and point dose values are nearly the same for measurement of surface dose from spiral CT. However, for measurement of surface dose from perfusion CT, the dose is overestimated by a factor of two or more with CTDI values in comparison with point dose values. Both CTDI and point dose measurement are valuable for evaluating CT scanner output and estimating patient dose.},

Promising results have recently been obtained in materials science and medicine. At the same time, the lack of a mathematical theory comparable with that of conventional CT limits the progress in this field. Such a theory is now suggested, establishing a fundamental relation between the three-dimensional Radon transform of the object function and the two-dimensional Radon transform of the phase-contrast projection. A reconstruction algorithm is derived in the form of a filtered backprojection. The filter function is given in the space and spatial-frequency domains. The theory suggested enables one to quantitatively determine the refractive index of a weakly absorbing medium from x-ray intensity data measured in the near-field region. The results of computer simulations are discussed.},

abstract = {Compared to single energy CT, which only provides information for x-ray linear attenuation coefficients, dual-energy CT is able to obtain both the electron density and effective atomic number for different materials in a quantitative way. In this study, as an alternative to dual-energy CT, a novel quantitative imaging method based on phase contrast CT is presented. Rather than requiring two projection data sets with different x-ray energy spectra, diffraction-grating-based phase contrast CT is capable of reconstructing images of both linear attenuation and refractive index decrement from the same projection data using a single x-ray energy spectra. From the two images, quantitative information of both the electron density and effective atomic number can be extracted. Two physical phantoms were constructed and used to validate the presented method. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) electron density can be accurately determined from refractive index decrement through a linear relationship, and (2) the effective atomic number can be explicitly derived from the ratio of the linear attenuation to refractive index decrement using a power function plus a constant. The presented method will provide insight into the technique of material separation and find its use in medical and industrial applications.},

abstract = {A simulation model of mammographic x-ray sources with finite size has been developed. The model is based on Monte Carlo methods and it takes into account the electron penetration inside the anode, the anode geometry and material, as well as the resulting heel effect and the spectral and spatial distribution of x-rays. This x-ray source simulation model has been embedded into an earlier developed simulation package of a mammography unit. The main outputs of this model are Monte Carlo generated images that correspond to the irradiation of properly designed phantoms. In this way it is possible to make studies of the influence of x-ray source characteristics on MTF. This paper presents the development of the mammographic x-ray source model, accompanied by a set of simulation studies concerning the influence of magnification effects as well as that of the x-ray spatial and spectral distribution on the mammographic spatial resolution for a certain magnification factor (m = 1.4). The validity level of the model, as well as its limitations and perspectives, rise through comparisons with experimental and theoretical data.},

@article{Long2010,
abstract = {Iterative methods for 3D image reconstruction have the potential to improve image quality over conventional filtered back projection (FBP) in X-ray computed tomography (CT). However, the computation burden of 3D cone-beam forward and back-projectors is one of the greatest challenges facing practical adoption of iterative methods for X-ray CT. Moreover, projector accuracy is also important for iterative methods. This paper describes two new separable footprint (SF) projector methods that approximate the voxel footprint functions as 2D separable functions. Because of the separability of these footprint functions, calculating their integrals over a detector cell is greatly simplified and can be implemented efficiently. The SF-TR projector uses trapezoid functions in the transaxial direction and rectangular functions in the axial direction, whereas the SF-TT projector uses trapezoid functions in both directions. Simulations and experiments showed that both SF projector methods are more accurate than the distance-driven (DD) projector, which is a current state-of-the-art method in the field. The SF-TT projector is more accurate than the SF-TR projector for rays associated with large cone angles. The SF-TR projector has similar computation speed with the DD projector and the SF-TT projector is about two times slower.},

  abstract={A software program, SpekCalc , is presented for the calculation of x-ray spectra from tungsten anode x-ray tubes. SpekCalc was designed primarily for use in a medical physics context, for both research and education purposes, but may also be of interest to those working with x-ray tubes in industry. Noteworthy is the particularly wide range of tube potentials (40–300 kVp) and anode angles (recommended: 6–30°) that can be modelled: the program is therefore potentially of use to those working in superficial/orthovoltage radiotherapy, as well as diagnostic radiology. The utility is free to download and is based on a deterministic model of x-ray spectrum generation (Poludniowski 2007 Med. Phys. 34 2175). Filtration can be applied for seven materials (air, water, Be, Al, Cu, Sn and W). In this note SpekCalc is described and illustrative examples are shown. Predictions are compared to those of a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo code (BEAMnrc) and, where possible, to an alternative, widely-used, spectrum calculation program (IPEM78).}

We developed a complete simulation framework for a grating-based interferometer. This Framework incorporates all contributing physical aspects, especially the particle and the wave behaviour of the X-ray photons, realistic noise, and a detailed X-ray source and detector description. Furthermore, we present simulation results and compare them with measurements taken in our lab using a corresponding grating-based interferometer setup.

abstract = {Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray has great potential for its applications in both diagnosis and treatment of diseases, due to its characteristic properties including coherence, collimation, monochromaticity, and exceptional brightness. Great advances have been made regarding potential medical applications of SR X-ray in recent years, particularly with the development of the third generation of SR light sources. However, multiple studies have also suggested damaging effects of SR X-ray on biological samples ranging from protein crystals to cells and biological tissues. It has become increasingly important to conduct comprehensive studies on two closely related topics regarding SR X-ray in medical applications: The safety issues regarding the medical applications of SR X-ray and the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between SR X-ray and biological tissues. In this article, we attempted to provide an overview of the literatures regarding these two increasingly significant topics. We also proposed our hypothesis that there are significant differences between the biological tissue-damaging mechanisms of SR X-ray and those of normal X-ray, due to the characteristic properties of SR X-ray such as high dose rate. Future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis, which may profoundly improve our understanding regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between light and matter. These studies would also constitute an essential basis for establishing the safety standard for the medical applications of SR X-ray.},

As recently demonstrated, phase-contrast imaging is characterized by its extraordinary image quality, greatly enhanced contrast, and good soft tissue discrimination with very high spatial resolution down to the micron and even the sub-micron region. The rapid development of compact X-ray sources of high brightness, tuneability, and monochromaticity as well as high-resolution X-ray detectors with high quantum efficiency and improved computational methods is stimulating the development of a new generation of X-ray imaging systems for medical applications. The present paper reviews some intrinsic mechanisms, recent technical developments and potential medical applications of two-, three- and four-dimensional phase-contrast X-ray imaging. Challenging issues in current phase-contrast imaging techniques and key clinical applications are discussed and possible developments of future high-contrast and high spatial and temporal resolution medical X-ray imaging systems are outlined.},

To monitor the morphological changes that the alveoli network undergoes in the progression of these diseases, we propose using the dark-field signal, which is related to small-angle scattering in the sample. Combined with the absorption-based image, the dark-field signal enables better discrimination between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue in a mouse model. All measurements have been performed at 36 keV using a monochromatic laser-driven miniature synchrotron X-ray source (Compact Light Source). In this paper we present grating-based dark-field images of emphysematous vs. healthy lung tissue, where the strong dependence of the dark-field signal on mean alveolar size leads to improved diagnosis of emphysema in lung radiographs.},

abstract = {3D reconstruction from 2D projections obtained along a single circular source trajectory is most commonly done using an algorithm due to Feldkamp, Davis and Kress. In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on a cone-beam to parallel-beam rebinning step, a corresponding rebinning step into a rectangular virtual detector plane and a filtered backprojection. This approach yields an improved image quality reflected by a decreased low-intensity drop which is well known for 3D reconstruction from projection data obtained along circular trajectories. At the same time the computational complexity is lower than in Feldkamp's original approach. Based on this idea, a hybrid 3D cone-beam reconstruction method is formulated that enlarges the reconstruction volume in its dimension along the rotation axis of the cone-beam CT system.

abstract = {Potential applications of grating-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging are investigated in various fields due to its compatibility with laboratory X-ray sources. So far the method was mainly restricted to X-ray energies below 40 keV, which is too low to examine dense or thick objects, but a routine operation at higher energies is on the brink of realisation. In this study, imaging results obtained at 82 keV are presented. These comprise a test object consisting of well-defined materials for a quantitative analysis and a tooth to translate the findings to a biomedical sample. Measured linear attenuation coefficients ? and electron densities ?e are in good agreement with theoretical values. Improved contrast-to-noise ratios were found in phase contrast compared to attenuation contrast. The combination of both contrast modalities further enables to simultaneously assess information on density and composition of materials with effective atomic numbers Z? > 8. In our biomedical example, we demonstrate the possibility to detect differences in mass density and calcium concentration within teeth.},

abstract = {X-ray in-line phase contrast has recently been combined with CO(2) angiography for high-resolution small-animal vascular imaging at low radiation dose. In this paper we further investigate the potential and limitations of this method and demonstrate observation of vessels down to 8 $\mu$m in diameter, considerably smaller than the 60 $\mu$m previously reported. Our in-line phase-contrast imaging system is based on a liquid-metal-jet-anode x-ray source and utilizes free-space propagation to convert phase shifts, caused by refractive index variations, into intensity differences. Enhanced refractive index variations are obtained through injection of CO(2) gas into the vascular system to replace the blood. We show rat-kidney images with blood vessels down to 27 $\mu$m in diameter and mouse-ear images with vessels down to 8 $\mu$m. The minimum size of observable blood vessels is found to be limited by the penetration of gas into the vascular system and the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. the allowed dose. The diameters of vessels being gas-filled depend on the gas pressure and follow a simple model based on surface tension. A theoretical signal-to-noise comparison shows that this method requires 1000 times less radiation dose than conventional iodine-based absorption contrast for observing sub-50 $\mu$m vessels.},

abstract = {B-splines are attractive basis functions for the continuous-domain representation of biomedical images and volumes. In this paper, we prove that the extended family of box splines are closed under the Radon transform and derive explicit formulae for their transforms. Our results are general; they cover all known brands of compactly-supported box splines (tensor-product B-splines, separable or not) in any number of dimensions. The proposed box spline approach extends to non-Cartesian lattices used for discretizing the image space. In particular, we prove that the 2-D Radon transform of an N-direction box spline is generally a (nonuniform) polynomial spline of degree N-1. The proposed framework allows for a proper discretization of a variety of tomographic reconstruction problems in a box spline basis. It is of relevance for imaging modalities such as X-ray computed tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. We provide experimental results that demonstrate the practical advantages of the box spline formulation for improving the quality and efficiency of tomographic reconstruction algorithms.},

@article{Hubbell1999,
abstract = {The probability of a photon (x-ray, gamma-ray, bremsstrahlung, etc) of a given energy E undergoing absorption or scattering when traversing a layer of material Z can be expressed quantitatively in terms of a linear attenuation coefficient mu (cm(-1)). Since mu is dependent on the material's density, rho (g cm(-3)), which can be variable, the quantity usually tabulated is the mass attenuation coefficient mu/rho (cm2 g(-1)) in which the dependence on the density has been removed. Mu/rho, in turn, can be obtained as the sum of the different types of possible interactions of photons with atoms of the material. For photon energies below 1 MeV the major interaction processes to be considered are incoherent (Compton) scattering, coherent (Rayleigh) scattering and atomic photoeffect absorption. Above 1 MeV one must also include nuclear-field pair production and atomic-field (triplet) production, and above 5 MeV one in principle should include photonuclear absorption, although the latter is neglected in data tabulations up to the present time. This review includes a selective history of measurements and theory relating to mu/rho from the turn of the century up to the present time, and is intended to provide a basis for further calculations and critical tabulations of photon cross section data, particularly as required by users in radiation medicine and biology. The mass energy-absorption coefficient mu(en)/rho is also briefly discussed.},

@article{Stampanoni2011,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: Phase-contrast and scattering-based x-ray imaging are known to provide additional and complementary information to conventional, absorption-based methods, and therefore have the potential to play a crucial role in medical diagnostics. We report on the first mammographic investigation of 5 native, that is, freshly dissected, breasts carried out with a grating interferometer and a conventional x-ray tube source. Four patients in this study had histopathologically proven invasive breast cancer. One male patient, without the presence of any malignant formations within the resected breast, was included as a control specimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We used a Talbot-Lau grating setup installed on a conventional, low-brilliance x-ray source; the interferometer operated at the fifth Talbot distance, at a tube voltage of 40 kVp with mean energy of 28 keV, and at a current of 25 mA. The device simultaneously recorded absorption, differential phase and small-angle scattering signals from the native breast tissue. These quantities were then combined into novel color- and high-frequency-enhanced radiographic images. Presurgical images (conventional mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging) supported the findings and clinical relevance was verified. RESULTS:: Our approach yields complementary and otherwise inaccessible information on the electron density distribution and the small-angle scattering power of the sample at the microscopic scale. This information can be used to potentially answer clinically relevant, yet unresolved questions such as unequivocally discerning between malignant and premalignant changes and postoperative scars and distinguishing cancer-invaded regions within healthy tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: We present the first ex vivo images of fresh, native breast tissue obtained from mastectomy specimens using grating interferometry. This technique yields improved diagnostic capabilities when compared with conventional mammography, especially when discerning the type of malignant conversions and their breadth within normal breast tissue.

@article{Thibault2008,
abstract = {Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) and scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) are two popular microscopy techniques that have evolved quite independently. CDI promises to reach resolutions below 10 nanometers, but the reconstruction procedures put stringent requirements on data quality and sample preparation. In contrast, STXM features straightforward data analysis, but its resolution is limited by the spot size on the specimen. We demonstrate a ptychographic imaging method that bridges the gap between CDI and STXM by measuring complete diffraction patterns at each point of a STXM scan. The high penetration power of x-rays in combination with the high spatial resolution will allow investigation of a wide range of complex mesoscopic life and material science specimens, such as embedded semiconductor devices or cellular networks.},

@article{Wen2008,
abstract = {Coherent X-ray scattering is related to the electron density distribution by a Fourier transform, and therefore a window into the microscopic structures of biological samples. Current techniques of scattering rely on small-angle measurements from highly collimated X-ray beams produced from synchrotron light sources. Imaging of the distribution of scattering provides a new contrast mechanism which is different from absorption radiography, but is a lengthy process of raster or line scans of the beam over the object. Here, we describe an imaging technique in the spatial frequency domain capable of acquiring both the scattering and absorption distributions in a single exposure. We present first results obtained with conventional X-ray equipment. This method interposes a grid between the X-ray source and the imaged object, so that the grid-modulated image contains a primary image and a grid harmonic image. The ratio between the harmonic and primary images is shown to be a pure scattering image. It is the auto-correlation of the electron density distribution at a specific distance. We tested a number of samples at 60-200 nm autocorrelation distance, and found the scattering images to be distinct from the absorption images and reveal new features. This technique is simple to implement, and should help broaden the imaging applications of X-ray scattering.},

The 30-70 W electron beam is magnetically focused onto the jet, producing a circular 7-13 $\mu$m full width half maximum x-ray spot. The measured spectral brightness at the 24.2 keV In K($\alpha$) line is 3 × 10(9) photons∕(s × mm(2) × mrad(2) × 0.1\% BW) at 30 W electron-beam power. The high photon energy compared to existing liquid-metal-jet sources increases the penetration depth and allows imaging of thicker samples. The applicability of the source in the biomedical field is demonstrated by high-resolution imaging of a mammography phantom and a phase-contrast angiography phantom.},

abstract = {In x-ray radiography, particularly for technical and industrial applications, a scanning setup is very often favorable when compared to a direct two-dimensional image acquisition. Here, we report on an efficient scanning method for grating based x-ray phase contrast imaging with tube based sources. It uses multiple line detectors for staggered acquisition of the individual phase-stepping images. We find that the total exposure time does not exceed the time needed in an equivalent scanning setup for absorption radiography. Therefore, we conclude that it should be possible to implement the method into a scanning system without affecting the scanning speed or significant increase in cost but with the advantage of providing both the phase contrast and the absorption information at once.},

abstract = {Iterative reconstruction algorithms are becoming increasingly important in electron tomography of biological samples. These algorithms, however, impose major computational demands. Parallelization must be employed to maintain acceptable running times. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been demonstrated to be highly cost-effective for carrying out these computations with a high degree of parallelism. In a recent paper by Xu et al. (2010), a GPU implementation strategy was presented that obtains a speedup of an order of magnitude over a previously proposed GPU-based electron tomography implementation. In this technical note, we demonstrate that by making alternative design decisions in the GPU implementation, an additional speedup can be obtained, again of an order of magnitude. By carefully considering memory access locality when dividing the workload among blocks of threads, the GPU's cache is used more efficiently, making more effective use of the available memory bandwidth.},

@article{Donath2010a,
abstract = {Objectives: X-ray computed tomography (CT) using phase contrast can provide images with greatly enhanced soft-tissue contrast in comparison to conventional attenuation-based CT. We report on the first scan of a human specimen recorded with a phase-contrast CT system based on an x-ray grating interferometer and a conventional x-ray tube source. Feasibility and potential applications of preclinical and clinical phase-contrast CT are discussed. Materials and Methods: A hand of an infant was scanned ex vivo at 40 kVp tube voltage. The simultaneously recorded attenuation and phase-contrast CT images were quantitatively compared with each other, by introducing a specific Hounsfield unit for phase-contrast imaging. Results: We observe significantly enhanced soft-tissue contrast in the phase images, when compared with the attenuation data. Particularly, tendons and ligaments appear with strongly increased contrast-to-noise ratio. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the huge potential of phase-contrast CT for clinical investigations of human specimens and, potentially, of humans. Because the applied technique works efficiently with conventional x-ray tubes and detectors, it is suitable for the realization of preclinical and clinical phase-contrast CT systems.},

@article{Khelashvili2006,
abstract = {We recently proposed a phase-sensitive x-ray imaging method called multiple-image radiography (MIR), which is an improvement on the diffraction-enhanced imaging technique. MIR simultaneously produces three images, depicting separately the effects of absorption, refraction and ultra-small-angle scattering of x-rays, and all three MIR images are virtually immune to degradation caused by scattering at higher angles. Although good results have been obtained using MIR, no quantitative model of the imaging process has yet been developed. In this paper, we present a theoretical prediction of the MIR image values in terms of fundamental physical properties of the object being imaged. We use radiative transport theory to model the beam propagation, and we model the object as a stratified medium containing discrete scattering particles. An important finding of our analysis is that the image values in all three MIR images are line integrals of various object parameters, which is an essential property for computed tomography to be achieved with conventional reconstruction methods. Our analysis also shows that MIR truly separates the effects of absorption, refraction and ultra-small-angle scattering for the case considered. We validate our analytical model using real and simulated imaging data.},

For quantitative analysis of these images, the phase needs to be retrieved numerically. There are many phase-retrieval methods available. Those suitable for phase-contrast tomography, i.e., non-iterative phase-retrieval methods that use only one image at each projection angle, all follow the same pattern though derived in different ways. We outline this pattern and use it to compare the methods to each other, considering only phase-retrieval performance and not the additional effects of tomographic reconstruction. We also outline derivations, approximations and assumptions, and show which methods are similar or identical and how they relate to each other. A simple scheme for choosing reconstruction method is presented, and numerical phase-retrieval performed for all methods.},

@article{Tapfer2013,
abstract = {To explore the potential of grating-based x-ray phase-contrast computed tomography (CT) for preclinical research, a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was investigated. One ex-vivo mouse specimen was scanned with different grating-based phase-contrast CT imaging setups covering two different settings: i) high-resolution synchrotron radiation (SR) imaging and ii) dose-reduced imaging using either synchrotron radiation or a conventional x-ray tube source. These experimental settings were chosen to assess the potential of phase-contrast imaging for two different types of application: i) high-performance imaging for virtual microscopy applications and ii) biomedical imaging with increased soft-tissue contrast for in-vivo applications. For validation and as a reference, histological slicing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed on the same mouse specimen. For each x-ray imaging setup, attenuation and phase-contrast images were compared visually with regard to contrast in general, and specifically concerning the recognizability of lesions and cancerous tissue. To quantitatively assess contrast, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of selected regions of interest (ROI) in the attenuation images and the phase images were analyzed and compared. It was found that both for virtual microscopy and for in-vivo applications, there is great potential for phase-contrast imaging: in the SR-based benchmarking data, fine details about tissue composition are accessible in the phase images and the visibility of solid tumor tissue under dose-reduced conditions is markedly superior in the phase images. The present study hence demonstrates improved diagnostic value with phase-contrast CT in a mouse model of a complex endogenous cancer, promoting the use and further development of grating-based phase-contrast CT for biomedical imaging applications.},

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how grating based phase-contrast CT can provide contrast superior to standard absorption based CT. The method of phase-contrast CT is applied to two samples of porcine subcutaneous fat and rind. The additional contrast obtained may be used for quality testing, to investigate variations in fatty acid composition of the fat-fraction, and density variations in the meat-fraction. The possibility of integrating the method into an abattoir environment is discussed.},

Moreover, projector accuracy is also important for iterative methods. This paper describes two new separable footprint (SF) projector methods that approximate the voxel footprint functions as 2D separable functions. Because of the separability of these footprint functions, calculating their integrals over a detector cell is greatly simplified and can be implemented efficiently. The SF-TR projector uses trapezoid functions in the transaxial direction and rectangular functions in the axial direction, whereas the SF-TT projector uses trapezoid functions in both directions. Simulations and experiments showed that both SF projector methods are more accurate than the distance-driven (DD) projector, which is a current state-of-the-art method in the field. The SF-TT projector is more accurate than the SF-TR projector for rays associated with large cone angles. The SF-TR projector has similar computation speed with the DD projector and the SF-TT projector is about two times slower.},

abstract = {It is known that the sensitivity of X-ray phase-contrast grating interferometry with regard to electron density variations present in the sample is related to the minimum detectable refraction angle. In this article a numerical framework is developed that allows for a realistic and quantitative determination of the sensitivity. The framework is validated by comparisons with experimental results and then used for the quantification of several influences on the sensitivity, such as spatial coherence or the number of phase step images. In particular, we identify the ideal inter-grating distance with respect to the highest sensitivity for parallel beam geometry. This knowledge will help to optimize existing synchrotron-based grating interferometry setups.},

In this paper, recent developments of this technique for application in bone research are reviewed.

The thickness of the mineral crystals was found to increase with age up to a value around 3 to 4 nanometers in adult animals, depending on the species. The SAXS results also suggest the existence of needle-shaped mineral crystals in mouse or rat bone and more plate-shaped crystals in other tissues like adult human bone or mineralized turkey leg tendon.},

Recently, based on the Talbot effect, groundbreaking work was reported using 1D gratings for X-ray phase-contrast imaging with a hospital-grade X-ray tube instead of a synchrotron or microfocused source. In this paper, we report an extension using 2D gratings that reduces the imaging time and increases the accuracy and robustness of phase retrieval compared to current grating-based phase-contrast techniques. Feasibility is demonstrated via numerical simulation.},

abstract = {Digital radiography offers the potential of improved image quality as well as providing opportunities for advances in medical image management, computer-aided diagnosis and teleradiology. Image quality is intimately linked to the precise and accurate acquisition of information from the x-ray beam transmitted by the patient, i.e. to the performance of the x-ray detector. Detectors for digital radiography must meet the needs of the specific radiological procedure where they will be used. Key parameters are spatial resolution, uniformity of response, contrast sensitivity, dynamic range, acquisition speed and frame rate. The underlying physical considerations defining the performance of x-ray detectors for radiography will be reviewed. Some of the more promising existing and experimental detector technologies which may be suitable for digital radiography will be considered. Devices that can be employed in full-area detectors and also those more appropriate for scanning x-ray systems will be discussed. These include various approaches based on phosphor x-ray converters, where light quanta are produced as an intermediate stage, as well as direct x-ray-to-charge conversion materials such as zinc cadmium telluride, amorphous selenium and crystalline silicon.},

abstract = {A software program, SpekCalc, is presented for the calculation of x-ray spectra from tungsten anode x-ray tubes. SpekCalc was designed primarily for use in a medical physics context, for both research and education purposes, but may also be of interest to those working with x-ray tubes in industry. Noteworthy is the particularly wide range of tube potentials (40-300 kVp) and anode angles (recommended: 6-30 degrees) that can be modelled: the program is therefore potentially of use to those working in superficial/orthovoltage radiotherapy, as well as diagnostic radiology. The utility is free to download and is based on a deterministic model of x-ray spectrum generation (Poludniowski 2007 Med. Phys. 34 2175). Filtration can be applied for seven materials (air, water, Be, Al, Cu, Sn and W). In this note SpekCalc is described and illustrative examples are shown. Predictions are compared to those of a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo code (BEAMnrc) and, where possible, to an alternative, widely-used, spectrum calculation program (IPEM78).},

We designed the gratings as a staircase array of multilayer stacks which are fabricated in a single thin film deposition process. We performed the experiments at 19 keV x-ray energy and 0.8 $\mu$m pixel resolution. The small grating period resulted in clear separation of different diffraction orders and multiple images on the detector. A slitted beam was used to remove overlap of the images from the different diffraction orders. The phase contrast images showed detailed features as small as 10 $\mu$m, and demonstrated the feasibility of high resolution x-ray phase contrast imaging with nanometer scale gratings.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of x-ray radiographic images, meaning the minimal detectable change in the thickness or in the index of refraction of a sample, is directly related to the uncertainty of the measurement method. In the following work, we report on the recent development of quantitative descriptions for the stochastic error of grating-based differential phase contrast imaging (DPCi). Our model includes the noise transfer characteristics of the x-ray detector and the jitter of the phase steps. We find that the noise in DPCi depends strongly on the phase stepping visibility and the sample properties. The results are supported by experimental evidence acquired with our new instrument with a field of view of 50x70 mm(2). Our conclusions provide general guidelines to optimize grating interferometers for specific applications and problems.},

abstract = {To explore the future clinical potential of improved soft-tissue visibility with grating-based X-ray phase contrast (PC), we have developed a first preclinical computed tomography (CT) scanner featuring a rotating gantry. The main challenge in the transition from previous bench-top systems to a preclinical scanner are phase artifacts that are caused by minimal changes in the grating alignment during gantry rotation. In this paper, we present the first experimental results from the system together with an adaptive phase recovery method that corrects for these phase artifacts. Using this method, we show that the scanner can recover quantitatively accurate Hounsfield units in attenuation and phase. Moreover, we present a first tomography scan of biological tissue with complementary information in attenuation and phase contrast. The present study hence demonstrates the feasibility of grating-based phase contrast with a rotating gantry for the first time and paves the way for future in vivo studies on small animal disease models (in the mid-term future) and human diagnostics applications (in the long-term future).},

@article{Sidky2008,
abstract = {An iterative algorithm, based on recent work in compressive sensing, is developed for volume image reconstruction from a circular cone-beam scan. The algorithm minimizes the total variation (TV) of the image subject to the constraint that the estimated projection data is within a specified tolerance of the available data and that the values of the volume image are non-negative. The constraints are enforced by the use of projection onto convex sets (POCS) and the TV objective is minimized by steepest descent with an adaptive step-size. The algorithm is referred to as adaptive-steepest-descent-POCS (ASD-POCS). It appears to be robust against cone-beam artifacts, and may be particularly useful when the angular range is limited or when the angular sampling rate is low. The ASD-POCS algorithm is tested with the Defrise disk and jaw computerized phantoms. Some comparisons are performed with the POCS and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. Although the algorithm is presented in the context of circular cone-beam image reconstruction, it can also be applied to scanning geometries involving other x-ray source trajectories.},

Samples with diameters from a few millimeters to a maximum of 14 mm can be measured, typically, bone biopsies with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of approximately 10 mm are measured. Spatial resolution is 28 microns. Usually the volume of interest contains 4 x 4 x 4 mm3 and is represented in 14 x 14 x 14 microns3 voxels. 3D stereological indices are extracted according to the standard definitions used in histomorphometry. Triangular surface representation is effected with an extended marching cube algorithm and forms a convenient basis for finite element analysis. Microtomographic measurements may be employed to "calibrate" lower-dose, lower-resolution images in vivo as well as to nondestructively assess unprocessed surgical bone biopsy specimens. These specimens remain intact for mechanical or histological testing.},

@article{Tapfer2011,
abstract = {Purpose: To explore the potential of grating-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging for clinical applications, a first compact gantry system was developed. It is designed such that it can be implemented into an in-vivo small-animal phase-contrast computed tomography (PC-CT) scanner. The purpose of the present study is to assess the accuracy and quantitativeness of the described gantry in both absorption and phase-contrast.Methods: A phantom, containing six chemically well-defined liquids, was constructed. A tomography scan with cone-beam reconstruction of this phantom was performed yielding the spatial distribution of the linear attenuation coefficient $\mu$ and decrement $\delta$ of the complex refractive index. Theoretical values of $\mu$ and $\delta$ were calculated for each liquid from tabulated data and compared with the experimentally measured values. Additionally, a color-fused image representation is proposed to display the complementary absorption and phase-contrast information in a single image.Results: Experimental and calculated data of the phantom agree well confirming the quantitativeness and accuracy of the reconstructed spatial distributions of $\mu$ and $\delta$. The proposed color-fused image representation, which combines the complementary absorption and phase information, considerably helps in distinguishing the individual substances.Conclusions: The concept of grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography (CT) can be implemented into a compact, cone-beam geometry gantry setup. The authors believe that this work represents an important milestone in translating phase-contrast x-ray imaging from previous proof-of-principle experiments to first preclinical biomedical imaging applications on small-animal models.},

abstract = {We have studied the size and orientation of mineral crystals in cortical bone of oim/oim mice, which are known to produce only alpha 1(I) collagen homotrimers and which may serve as a model for human osteogenesis imperfecta. Long bones (femur and tibia) from young (5 wk old) oim/oim mice and from unaffected heterozygous counterparts were investigated by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), which is sensitive to structures smaller than 50 nm. Mineral crystals were compared in terms of their thickness and their alignment with respect to the long bone axis. While electron microscopic tomography has recently shown the existence of large mineral blocks (with all dimensions typically exceeding 50 nm) in mineralized tendons of oim/oim mice, SAXS revealed a family of thin, possibly needle-like, crystals in cortical bone. These crystals were similar in shape to those observed previously in normal mice, but they were thinner and less well aligned in oim/oim mice relative to heterozygotes. Moreover, the crystal thickness and their alignment with the bone axis were more variable in oim/oim bone, with a close correlation (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) between the two parameters. The presence of smaller crystals with more variable alignment in corticalis of oim/oim mice may contribute to the brittleness of their bone, similar to that of human osteogenesis imperfecta.},

@article{Potdevin2012,
abstract = {The understanding of large biophysical systems at the systems level often depends on a precise knowledge of their microstructure. This is difficult to obtain, especially in vivo, because most imaging methods are either limited in terms of achievable field of view, or make use of penetrating ionizing radiations such as x-rays, in which case the resolution is severely limited by the deposited dose. Here, we describe a new method, x-ray vector radiography (XVR), which yields various types of information about the local orientation, anisotropy and average size of the sample microstructures. We demonstrate the feasibility by showing first experimental XVRs of human vertebra bone samples, giving information on the trabecular structures even with a pixel resolution of half a millimetre, much larger than the structures themselves. This last point is critical for the development of low-dose measurement methods which will allow for in vivo studies and potentially in the future for new medical diagnostics methods of bone metabolic disorder diseases such as osteoporosis.},

abstract = {X-ray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging. It can deliver the three-dimensional internal structure of entire organisms as well as that of single cells, and even gives access to quantitative information, crucially important both for medical applications and for basic research. Most frequently such information is based on X-ray attenuation. Phase contrast is sometimes used for improved visibility but remains significantly harder to quantify. Here we describe an X-ray computed tomography technique that generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps from phase contrast information without reverting to assumptions of a weak phase object or negligible absorption. This method uses a ptychographic coherent imaging approach to record tomographic data sets, exploiting both the high penetration power of hard X-rays and the high sensitivity of lensless imaging. As an example, we present images of a bone sample in which structures on the 100 nm length scale such as the osteocyte lacunae and the interconnective canalicular network are clearly resolved. The recovered electron density map provides a contrast high enough to estimate nanoscale bone density variations of less than one per cent. We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and materials sciences.},

@article{Stutman2011a,
abstract = {A high-resolution radiographic method for soft tissues in the small joints of the hand would aid in the study and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), which often attacks these joints. Of particular interest would be imaging with <100 µm resolution the joint cartilage, whose integrity is a main indicator of disease. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) or refraction-based x-ray imaging with Talbot grating interferometers could provide such a method, since it enhances soft tissue contrast and can be implemented with conventional x-ray tubes. A numerical joint phantom was first developed to assess the angular sensitivity and spectrum needed for a hand DPC system. The model predicts that, due to quite similar refraction indexes for joint soft tissues, the refraction effects are very small, requiring high angular resolution. To compare our model to experiment we built a high-resolution bench-top interferometer using 10 µm period gratings, a W anode tube and a CCD-based detector. Imaging experiments on animal cartilage and on a human finger support the model predictions. For instance, the estimated difference between the index of refraction of cartilage and water is of only several percent at ∼25 keV mean energy, comparable to that between the linear attenuation coefficients. The potential advantage of DPC imaging thus comes mainly from the edge enhancement at the soft tissue interfaces. Experiments using a cadaveric human finger are also qualitatively consistent with the joint model, showing that refraction contrast is dominated by tendon embedded in muscle, with the cartilage layer difficult to observe in our conditions. Nevertheless, the model predicts that a DPC radiographic system for the small hand joints of the hand could be feasible using a low energy quasi-monochromatic source, such as a K-edge filtered Rh or Mo tube, in conjunction with a ∼2 m long 'symmetric' interferometer operated in a high Talbot order.},

@article{Zanette2012a,
abstract = {X-ray grating interferometry is a coherent imaging technique that bears tremendous potential for three-dimensional tomographic imaging of soft biological tissue and other specimens whose details exhibit very weak absorption contrast. It is intrinsically trimodal, delivering phase contrast, absorption contrast, and scattering ("dark-field") contrast. Recently reported acquisition strategies for grating-interferometric phase tomography constitute a major improvement of dose efficiency and speed. In particular, some of these techniques eliminate the need for scanning of one of the gratings ("phase stepping"). This advantage, however, comes at the cost of other limitations. These can be a loss in spatial resolution, or the inability to fully separate the three imaging modalities. In the present paper we report a data acquisition and processing method that optimizes dose efficiency but does not share the main limitations of other recently reported methods. Although our method still relies on phase stepping, it effectively uses only down to a single detector frame per projection angle and yields images corresponding to all three contrast modalities. In particular, this means that dark-field imaging remains accessible. The method is also compliant with data acquisition over an angular range of only 180° and with a continuous rotation of the specimen.},

abstract = {Scanning X-ray microprobes are unique tools for the nanoscale investigation of specimens from the life, environmental, materials and other fields of sciences. Typically they utilize absorption and fluorescence as contrast mechanisms. Phase contrast is a complementary technique that can provide strong contrast with reduced radiation dose for weakly absorbing structures in the multi-keV range. In this paper the development of a segmented charge-integrating silicon detector which provides simultaneous absorption and differential phase contrast is reported. The detector can be used together with a fluorescence detector for the simultaneous acquisition of transmission and fluorescence data. It can be used over a wide range of photon energies, photon rates and exposure times at third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, and is currently operating at two beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source. Images obtained at around 2 keV and 10 keV demonstrate the superiority of phase contrast over absorption for specimens composed of light elements.},

abstract = {A new method for extracting quantitative information from phase-contrast x-ray images obtained with microfocus x-ray sources is presented. The proposed technique allows rapid noninvasive characterization of the internal structure of thick optically opaque organic samples. The method does not generally involve any sample preparation and does not need any x-ray optical elements (such as monochromators, zone plates, or interferometers). As a consequence, samples can be imaged in vivo or in vitro, and the images are free from optical aberrations. While alternative techniques of x-ray phase-contrast imaging usually require expensive synchrotron radiation sources, our method can be implemented with conventional, albeit microfocus, x-ray tubes, which greatly enhances its practicality. In the present work, we develop the theoretical framework, perform numerical simulations, and present the first experimental results, demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach.

@article{Guigay2004,
abstract = {The Talbot effect is the self-imaging, at distances D multiple of D(R), of the intensity downstream of a periodic object. Earlier work with hard synchrotron radiation X-rays showed the variation with D of the fundamental Fourier component of intensity to be a good measurement of beam coherence. Any higher-order Fourier coefficients I (D, m > 1) would be periodic with a reduced period D(Rm) = D(R)/m for an ideally coherent incident beam (partial Talbot effect). The degree of coherence gamma(x) is sampled through the ratio of I (D, m) at D = 0 and multiples of D(Rm). This requires the Fourier coefficient for D = 0, which is not accessible for a phase object (no contrast at D = 0). However, the ratio of the slopes of I (D, m) at D = 0 and D = pD(Rm) also provides this information. Furthermore, a characterization of gamma(x) is possible, provided an assumption is made on its shape, using only the ratio of the Fourier coefficient I (D, m) of two images a distance pD(Rm) apart. Experiments with one- and two-dimensional phase gratings and a mixed (amplitude and phase) two-dimensional grating confirm that the partial Talbot effect approach is viable. It requires a reduced range of distances, and yields important results directly, obviating the need for computer fits. In particular, 8\% of the beam intensity was found to have very low coherence in the vertical direction, probably due to monochromator imperfection.},

abstract = {Recently, x-ray differential phase contrast computed tomography (DPC-CT) has been experimentally implemented using a conventional tube combined with gratings. Images were reconstructed using a parallel-beam reconstruction formula. However, parallel-beam reconstruction formulae are not applicable when the parallel-beam approximation fails. In this paper, we present a new image reconstruction formula for fan-beam DPC-CT. There are several novel features of the new image reconstruction formula: (i) when the scanning angular range of data acquisition is larger than pi + gamma(m) (gamma(m) is the full fan angle), the entire field of view can be exactly reconstructed; (ii) when the scanning angular range is smaller than pi + gamma(m), a local region of interest (ROI) can be exactly reconstructed; (iii) it enables an exact reconstruction for a local ROI when the projection data are truncated at some view angles; (iv) it enlarges the imaging field of view when the detector is asymmetrically placed. In this last case, the data are truncated from every view angle. Numerical simulations have been conducted to validate the new reconstruction formula.},

Unlike clinical CT, a three-dimensional reconstruction array is created directly, rather than a series of two-dimensional slices. All structural indices commonly determined from two-dimensional histologic sections can be obtained nondestructively from a large number of slices in each of three orthogonal directions. This permits a comprehensive description of structural variation within a specimen and greatly facilitates the study of structural anisotropy. A measure of three-dimensional connectivity (Euler number/tissue volume) has been determined for the first time in human cancellous bone and shown to correlate with several two-dimensional histomorphometric indices. The method has the potential for overcoming many of the limitations of current approaches to the study of bone architecture at the microscopic level.},

Photon statistics cause errors in the phase of the moir\'{e} fringes and impose a detection limit on the wavefront gradient. The relation between the incident photon number and the detection limit is determined, and a figure of merit of XTI for a monochromatic cone beam is then defined. The dependence of the figure of merit on optical system parameters, such as grating pitch and position, is then discussed. The effects of varying the pattern height and linewidth of the second grating are shown for rectangular and trapezoidal teeth. Finally, we show how to design a practical cone-beam Talbot interferometer for certain boundary conditions.},

Here, the first multimodal X-ray imaging experiments at the Compact Light Sourbibce at a clinically compatible X-ray energy of 21 keV are reported.

We develop the formalism for the optical resolution of all types of nonlinear systems.

@article{Lundstrom2012b,
abstract = {We demonstrate a laboratory method for imaging small blood vessels using x-ray propagation-based phase-contrast imaging and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) gas as a contrast agent. The limited radiation dose in combination with CO(2) being clinically acceptable makes the method promising for small-diameter vascular visualization. We investigate the possibilities and limitations of the method for small-animal angiography and compare it with conventional absorption-based x-ray angiography. Photon noise in absorption-contrast imaging prevents visualization of blood vessels narrower than 50 µm at the highest radiation doses compatible with living animals, whereas our simulations and experiments indicate the possibility of visualizing 20 µm vessels at radiation doses as low as 100 mGy. Experimental computed tomography of excised rat kidney shows blood vessels of diameters down to 60 µm with improved image quality compared to absorption-based methods. With our present prototype x-ray source, the acquisition time for a tomographic dataset is approximately 1 h, which is long compared to the 1-20 min common for absorption-contrast micro-CT systems. Further development of the liquid-metal-jet microfocus x-ray sources used here and high-resolution x-ray detectors shows promise to reduce exposure times and make this high-resolution method practical for imaging of living animals.},

We propose a condition for the data acquisition that ensures that all object points between two successive circles are irradiated over an angular span of the x-ray source position of exactly 360 degrees in total as seen along the rotation axis. A fast and efficient approximative reconstruction method for the proposed acquisition is presented which uses data from exactly 360 degrees for every object point. It is based on the Tent-FDK method which was recently developed for single circular cone-beam CT. The measurement geometry does not provide sufficient data for exact reconstruction but it is shown that the proposed reconstruction method provides satisfying image quality for small cone angles.},

@article{Joseph1982,
abstract = {It is often desired to calculate line integrals through a field of reconstructed CT density pixels for the purpose of improving CT image quality. Two algorithms widely published and discussed in the past are known to either degrade spatial resolution or generate errors in the results due to the discontinuous "square pixel" modeling of the reconstructed image. An algorithm is described, based on linear interpolation between pixels, which provides superior accuracy without unnecessary loss of resolution. It was tested on simulated data for a head section and on a narrow Gaussian density distribution. The experimental results demonstrated improved performance. The method is expected to prove useful for many types of post-reconstruction processing, including beam hardening, missing data, and noise supression algorithms.},

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {The goal of this paper was to investigate the benefits that could be realistically achieved on a microCT imaging system with an energy-resolved photon-counting x-ray detector. To this end, we built and evaluated a prototype microCT system based on such a detector. The detector is based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) radiation sensors and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) readouts. Each detector pixel can simultaneously count x-ray photons above six energy thresholds, providing the capability for energy-selective x-ray imaging. We tested the spectroscopic performance of the system using polychromatic x-ray radiation and various filtering materials with Kabsorption edges. Tomographic images were then acquired of a cylindrical PMMA phantom containing holes filled with various materials. Results were also compared with those acquired using an intensity-integrating x-ray detector and single-energy (i.e. non-energy-selective) CT. This paper describes the functionality and performance of the system, and presents preliminary spectroscopic and tomographic results. The spectroscopic experiments showed that the energy- resolved photon-counting detector was capable of measuring energy spectra from polychromatic sources like a standard x-ray tube, and resolving absorption edges present in the energy range used for imaging. However, the spectral quality was degraded by spectral distortions resulting from degrading factors, including finite energy resolution and charge sharing. We developed a simple charge-sharing model to reproduce these distortions. The tomographic experiments showed that the availability of multiple energy thresholds in the photon-counting detector allowed us to simultaneously measure target-to-background contrasts in different energy ranges. Compared with single-energy CT with an integrating detector, this feature was especially useful to improve differentiation of materials with different attenuation coefficient energy dependences.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

@article{McDonald2009,
abstract = {Phase-sensitive X-ray imaging methods can provide substantially increased contrast over conventional absorption-based imaging, and therefore new and otherwise inaccessible information. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) imaging, which uses a grating interferometer and a phase-stepping technique, has been integrated into TOMCAT, a beamline dedicated to tomographic microscopy and coherent radiology experiments at the Swiss Light Source. Developments have been made focusing on the fast acquisition and post-processing of data to enable a high-throughput of samples, with obvious advantages, also through increasing the efficiency of the detecting system, of helping to reduce radiation dose imparted to the sample. A novel aquarium design allows a vertical rotation axis below the sample with measurements performed in aqueous environment. Optimization of the data acquisition procedure enables a full phase volume (1024 x 1024 pixels x 1000 projections x 9 phase steps, i.e. 9000 projections in total) to be acquired in 20 min (with a pixel size of 7.4 microm), and the subsequent post-processing has been integrated into the beamline pipeline for sinogram generation. Local DPC tomography allows one to focus with higher magnification on a particular region of interest of a sample without the presence of local tomography reconstruction artifacts. Furthermore, 'widefield' imaging is shown for DPC scans for the first time, enabling the field of view of the imaging system to be doubled for samples that are larger than the magnification allows. A case study is illustrated focusing on the visualization of soft tissue features, and particularly the substantia nigra of a rat brain. Darkfield images, based on local X-ray scattering, can also be extracted from a grating-based DPC scan: an example of the advantages of darkfield contrast is shown and the potential of darkfield X-ray tomography is discussed.},

abstract = {The influence of polychromaticity of the X-ray source on the performance of an X-ray Talbot interferometer applied for phase-contrast imaging is analyzed through numerical simulations based on the Fresnel diffraction theory. The presented simulation results show that the visibility of the self-image is fairly insensitive to the source polychromaticity and explain why the interferometer could be well combined with polychromatic X-ray sources in recent experiments. Furthermore, the self-image with a high visibility can be obtained under polychromatic illumination even at a high-order fractional Talbot distance. This fact implies that the acquired image quality for phase measurements can be improved, since the primary signal for phase measurement is proportional to the inter-grating distance. Finally, we mention that the results are also valid for Talbot-Lau interferometer and scanning double-grating configuration.},

abstract = {A simulation model of mammographic x-ray sources with finite size has been developed. The model is based on Monte Carlo methods and it takes into account the electron penetration inside the anode, the anode geometry and material, as well as the resulting heel effect and the spectral and spatial distribution of x-rays. This x-ray source simulation model has been embedded into an earlier developed simulation package of a mammography unit. The main outputs of this model are Monte Carlo generated images that correspond to the irradiation of properly designed phantoms. In this way it is possible to make studies of the influence of x-ray source characteristics on MTF. This paper presents the development of the mammographic x-ray source model, accompanied by a set of simulation studies concerning the influence of magnification effects as well as that of the x-ray spatial and spectral distribution on the mammographic spatial resolution for a certain magnification factor (m = 1.4). The validity level of the model, as well as its limitations and perspectives, rise through comparisons with experimental and theoretical data.},

@article{Weich2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The critical analysis of baseline factors has been found to be useful to predict virologic nonresponse (NR), relapse, or sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who receive antiviral therapy. In the present retrospective study we tried to find out whether gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) may be one of the baseline factors which are of special predictive power. We analyzed, in patients with different treatment outcomes, the predictive power of established baseline factors either in combination with GGT or by evaluating the predictive value of GGT independently. METHODS: Individual data from 632 patients chronically infected with HCV type 1 (n = 561) or type 2/3 (n = 71) were analyzed. All patients had received their first course of antiviral therapy and were treated with pegylated interferon $\alpha$-2a or -2b plus ribavirin. RESULTS: In patients with HCV type 1, a multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis identified low GGT (p < 0.0001), high cholesterol (p < 0.0001), age ≤40 years (p < 0.0001), high alanine aminotransferase (p = 0.0006), low viremia (p = 0.0014), and absence of cirrhosis (p = 0.0164) as independent predictors. While these baseline factors heralded improved virologic response, high GGT, in contrast, was significantly associated with NR (p < 0.0001). A strong correlation was found between log(10) GGT and a scoring variable S (r = -0.26 for prediction of SVR, p < 0.001; r = 0.11 for prediction of NR, p = 0.016) summarizing predictive information from other baseline factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings prove the predictive sensitivity of GGT as an independent indicator of nonresponsiveness even at levels that are slightly above the normal range. This new predictive parameter may help to improve individualized therapy in HCV type-1 infection.},

@article{Pinzer2012,
abstract = {One of the core pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. Current efforts of medical imaging research aim at visualizing amyloid plaques in living patients in order to evaluate the progression of the pathology, but also to facilitate the diagnosis of AD at the prodromal stage. In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of a new experimental imaging setup to image amyloid plaques in the brain of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. This imaging setup relies on a grating interferometer at a synchrotron X-ray source to measure the differential phase contrast between brain tissue and amyloid plaques. It provides high-resolution images with a large field of view, making it possible to scan an entire mouse brain. Here, we showed that this setup yields sufficient contrast to detect amyloid plaques and to quantify automatically several important structural parameters, such as their size and their regional density in 3D, on the scale of a whole mouse brain. Whilst future developments are required to apply this technique in vivo, this grating-based setup already gives the possibility to perform powerful studies aiming at quantifying the amyloid pathology in mouse models of AD and might accelerate the evaluation of anti-amyloid compounds. In addition, this technique may also facilitate the development of other amyloid imaging methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) by providing convenient high-resolution 3D data of the plaque distribution for multimodal comparison.},

@article{Biggs1997,
abstract = {A new technique for the acceleration of iterative image restoration algorithms is proposed. The method is based on the principles of vector extrapolation and does not require the minimization of a cost function. The algorithm is derived and its performance illustrated with Richardson-Lucy (R-L) and maximum entropy (ME) deconvolution algorithms and the Gerchberg-Saxton magnitude and phase retrieval algorithms. Considerable reduction in restoration times is achieved with little image distortion or computational overhead per iteration. The speedup achieved is shown to increase with the number of iterations performed and is easily adapted to suit different algorithms. An example R-L restoration achieves an average speedup of 40 times after 250 iterations and an ME method 20 times after only 50 iterations. An expression for estimating the acceleration factor is derived and confirmed experimentally. Comparisons with other acceleration techniques in the literature reveal significant improvements in speed and stability.},

@article{Groso2006,
abstract = {We report the implementation of a method which can yield the 3D distribution of the phase (refractive index) of a weakly absorbing object from a single tomographic data set. In order to reduce the residual absorption artifact (due to the fact that only one data set is used) the original algorithm presented by A. V. Bronnikov is amended by adding in the filter a factor found by using a semi empirical approach. The quality of the reconstruction is largely sufficient for optimal segmentation and further postprocessing even though the filter correction is based on assumption of constant absorption. This one step approach allows keeping radiation dose to the minimum. Spatial resolution is comparable to the conventional absorption based technique. The performance of the method is validated by using an established phase contrast technique.},

@article{Wernick2006,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the possibility of computing quantitatively accurate images of mass density variations in soft tissue. This is a challenging task, because density variations in soft tissue, such as the breast, can be very subtle. Beginning from an image of refraction angle created by either diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI) or multiple-image radiography (MIR), we estimate the mass-density image using a constrained least squares (CLS) method. The CLS algorithm yields accurate density estimates while effectively suppressing noise. Our method improves on an analytical method proposed by Hasnah et al (2005 Med. Phys. 32 549-52), which can produce significant artefacts when even a modest level of noise is present. We present a quantitative evaluation study to determine the accuracy with which mass density can be determined in the presence of noise. Based on computer simulations, we find that the mass-density estimation error can be as low as a few per cent for typical density variations found in the breast. Example images computed from less-noisy real data are also shown to illustrate the feasibility of the technique. We anticipate that density imaging may have application in assessment of water content of cartilage resulting from osteoarthritis, in evaluation of bone density, and in mammographic interpretation.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {X-ray differential phase contrast imaging methods, including projection imaging and the corresponding computed tomography (CT), have been implemented using a Talbot interferometer and either a synchrotron beam line or a low brilliance x-ray source generated by a stationary-anode x-ray tube. From small-angle scattering events which occur as an x-ray propagates through a medium, a signal intensity loss can be recorded and analyzed for an understanding of the micro-structures in an image object. This has been demonstrated using a Talbot-Lau interferometer and a stationary-anode x-ray tube. In this paper, theoretical principles and an experimental implementation of the corresponding CT imaging method are presented. First, a line integral is derived from analyzing the cross section of the small-angle scattering events. This method is referred to as small-angle scattering computed tomography (SAS-CT). Next, a Talbot-Lau interferometer and a rotating-anode x-ray tube were used to implement SAS-CT. A physical phantom and human breast tissue sample were used to demonstrate the reconstructed SAS-CT image volumes.},

abstract = {A systematic analysis has been performed that predicts the existence of 36 cases in which 100\% modulated, square-wave irradiance distributions can be generated in the Fresnel regime by simple binary-phase gratings. These types of distributions, referred to here as Lohmann images, have been previously predicted by researchers studying phase gratings known as Talbot array illuminators. Twenty of the cases are reported, to the best of my knowledge, for the first time. Sixteen of these new cases result in Lohmann images with twice the spatial frequency of the original grating. Experimental verifications of the theoretical predictions are presented.},

One important problem is the development of methods to make it suitable for use at very high x-ray energies, needed in many applications. We show how the edge illumination concept, which stands at the basis of the coded-aperture method, allows achieving hyperintense phase signals at energies close to 100 keV, by showing images of both weak phase objects and highly absorbing fossils with a high iron content.},

The ability to acquire the desired information within a single exposure is important for dynamic samples, as is sufficient sensitivity to reveal small variations in the composition or thickness of such a sample. This approach satisfies both these needs by analyzing how a reference grid pattern is deformed by the presence of the sample, similar to a Shack-Hartmann sensor. By resolving the shift of the pattern into horizontal and vertical components, a quantitative phase depth map is recovered, sensitive to both sharp edges as well as low phase gradients.},

@article{Bauhs2008,
abstract = {In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the most common parameter used to estimate and minimize patient dose is the CT dose index (CTDI). The CTDI is a volume-averaged measure that is used in situations where the table is incremented in conjunction with the tube rotation. Variants of the CTDI correct for averaging across the field of view and for adjacent beam overlaps or gaps. CTDI is usually measured with a pencil-shaped ionization chamber, although methods have been developed that use alternative detectors, including an optically stimulated luminescence probe and a solid-state real-time dosimeter. Because the CTDI represents an averaged dose to a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, the measurements are only an approximation of the patient dose. Furthermore, dose from interventional or perfusion CT, in which the table remains stationary between multiple scans, is best evaluated with point dose measurements made with small detectors. CTDI and point dose values are nearly the same for measurement of surface dose from spiral CT. However, for measurement of surface dose from perfusion CT, the dose is overestimated by a factor of two or more with CTDI values in comparison with point dose values. Both CTDI and point dose measurement are valuable for evaluating CT scanner output and estimating patient dose.},

@article{Reitz2011,
abstract = {The global prevalence of dementia is estimated to be as high as 24 million, and is predicted to double every 20 years through to 2040, leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, which typically begins with deterioration in memory. Before death, individuals with this disorder have usually become dependent on caregivers. The neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques-which are frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites-and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies are often accompanied by the presence of reactive microgliosis and the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying the neuropathological changes in AD remain unclear, but are probably affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we provide an overview of the criteria used in the diagnosis of AD, highlighting how this disease is related to, but distinct from, normal aging. We also summarize current information relating to AD prevalence, incidence and risk factors, and review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis.},

abstract = {We analyze the signal and noise propagation of differential phase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) compared with conventional attenuation-based computed tomography (CT) from a theoretical point of view. This work focuses on grating-based differential phase-contrast imaging. A mathematical framework is derived that is able to analytically predict the relative performance of both imaging techniques in the sense of the relative contrast-to-noise ratio for the contrast of any two materials. Two fundamentally different properties of PCT compared with CT are identified. First, the noise power spectra show qualitatively different characteristics implying a resolution-dependent performance ratio. The break-even point is derived analytically as a function of system parameters such as geometry and visibility. A superior performance of PCT compared with CT can only be achieved at a sufficiently high spatial resolution. Second, due to periodicity of phase information which is non-ambiguous only in a bounded interval statistical phase wrapping can occur. This effect causes a collapse of information propagation for low signals which limits the applicability of phase-contrast imaging at low dose.},

@article{Mader2012,
abstract = {Wood, trabecular bone, coral, liquid foams, grains in polycrystals, igneous rock, and even many types of food share many structural similarities and belong to the general class called cellular materials. The visualization of these materials in 3D has been made possible in the last decades through a variety of imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed X-ray tomography ($\mu$CT), and confocal microscopy. Recent advances in synchrotron-based ultra fast tomography have enabled measurements in liquid foams with thousands of bubbles and time resolutions down to 0.5 seconds. Post-processing techniques have, however, not kept pace and extracting useful physical metrics from such measurements is far from trivial. In this manuscript we present and validate a new, fully-automated method for segmenting and labeling the void space in cellular materials where the walls between cells are not visible or present. The individual cell labeling is based on a new tool, the Gradient Guided Watershed, which, while computationally simple, can be robustly scaled to large data-sets. Specifically we demonstrate the utility of this new method on several liquid foams (with varying liquid fraction and polydispersity) composed of thousands of bubbles, and the subsequent quantitative 3D structural characterization of those foams.},

Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), a phase contrast x-ray imaging technique, has greater soft tissue contrast than conventional radiography and generates higher resolution images than magnetic resonance microimaging. Thus, in this proof of principle study, DEI in micro-CT mode was performed on the brains of AD-model mice to determine if DEI can visualize Abeta plaques. Results revealed small nodules in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. Histology confirmed that the features seen in the DEI images of the brain were Abeta plaques. Several anatomical structures, including hippocampal subregions and white matter tracks, were also observed. Thus, DEI has strong promise in early diagnosis of AD, as well as general studies of the mouse brain.},

Different groups have evaluated the linear attenuation coefficients of breast tissues by carrying out direct attenuation measurements in which the specimens were thin and selected as homogeneous as possible. Here, we use monochromatic and high-intensity synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SR CT) to evaluate the linear attenuation coefficients of surgical breast tissues in the energy range from 15 to 26.5 keV. X-ray detection is performed by a custom digital silicon micro-strip device, developed in the framework of the PICASSO INFN experiment. Twenty-three human surgical breast samples were selected for SR CT and histological study. Six of them underwent CT, both as fresh tissue and after formalin fixation, while the remaining 17 were imaged only as formalin-fixed tissues. Our results for fat and fibrous tissues are in good agreement with the published values. However, in contrast to the published data, our measurements show no significant differences between fibrous and tumor tissues. Moreover, our results for fresh and formalin-fixed tissues demonstrate a reduction of the linear attenuation coefficient for fibrous and tumor tissues after fixation.},

Non-irradiated sucrose solutions are optically "empty" in the visible and near UV range. After gamma irradiation an absorption band with a maximum at 263 nm appears. It was confirmed that this band can be used as dosimetric signal for the dose range: 1-10 kGy. The species responsible for the 263 nm band is a neutral product of sucrose oxidation by an OH radical. High energy electron irradiation creates another UV absorbing species with the absorption band peaked at 270 nm. Further investigations are necessary to establish to what extent it can be used for electron beam dosimetry.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The US government spends more than \$200 million annually on abstinence-promotion programs, including virginity pledges. This study compares the sexual activity of adolescent virginity pledgers with matched nonpledgers by using more robust methods than past research. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects for this study were National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health respondents, a nationally representative sample of middle and high school students who, when surveyed in 1995, had never had sex or taken a virginity pledge and who were >15 years of age (n = 3440). Adolescents who reported taking a virginity pledge on the 1996 survey (n = 289) were matched with nonpledgers (n = 645) by using exact and nearest-neighbor matching within propensity score calipers on factors including prepledge religiosity and attitudes toward sex and birth control. Pledgers and matched nonpledgers were compared 5 years after the pledge on self-reported sexual behaviors and positive test results for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, and safe sex outside of marriage by use of birth control and condoms in the past year and at last sex. RESULTS: Five years after the pledge, 82\% of pledgers denied having ever pledged. Pledgers and matched nonpledgers did not differ in premarital sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and anal and oral sex variables. Pledgers had 0.1 fewer past-year partners but did not differ in lifetime sexual partners and age of first sex. Fewer pledgers than matched nonpledgers used birth control and condoms in the past year and birth control at last sex. CONCLUSIONS: The sexual behavior of virginity pledgers does not differ from that of closely matched nonpledgers, and pledgers are less likely to protect themselves from pregnancy and disease before marriage. Virginity pledges may not affect sexual behavior but may decrease the likelihood of taking precautions during sex. Clinicians should provide birth control information to all adolescents, especially virginity pledgers.},

@article{Weber2012,
abstract = {Prenatal heart valve interventions aiming at the early and systematic correction of congenital cardiac malformations represent a promising treatment option in maternal-fetal care. However, definite fetal valve replacements require growing implants adaptive to fetal and postnatal development. The presented study investigates the fetal implantation of prenatally engineered living autologous cell-based heart valves. Autologous amniotic fluid cells (AFCs) were isolated from pregnant sheep between 122 and 128 days of gestation via transuterine sonographic sampling. Stented trileaflet heart valves were fabricated from biodegradable PGA-P4HB composite matrices (n = 9) and seeded with AFCs in vitro. Within the same intervention, tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs) and unseeded controls were implanted orthotopically into the pulmonary position using an in-utero closed-heart hybrid approach. The transapical valve deployments were successful in all animals with acute survival of 77.8\% of fetuses. TEHV in-vivo functionality was assessed using echocardiography as well as angiography. Fetuses were harvested up to 1 week after implantation representing a birth-relevant gestational age. TEHVs showed in vivo functionality with intact valvular integrity and absence of thrombus formation. The presented approach may serve as an experimental basis for future human prenatal cardiac interventions using fully biodegradable autologous cell-based living materials.},

@article{Stutman2011,
abstract = {A high-resolution radiographic method for soft tissues in the small joints of the hand would aid in the study and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), which often attacks these joints. Of particular interest would be imaging with <100 µm resolution the joint cartilage, whose integrity is a main indicator of disease. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) or refraction-based x-ray imaging with Talbot grating interferometers could provide such a method, since it enhances soft tissue contrast and can be implemented with conventional x-ray tubes. A numerical joint phantom was first developed to assess the angular sensitivity and spectrum needed for a hand DPC system. The model predicts that, due to quite similar refraction indexes for joint soft tissues, the refraction effects are very small, requiring high angular resolution. To compare our model to experiment we built a high-resolution bench-top interferometer using 10 µm period gratings, a W anode tube and a CCD-based detector. Imaging experiments on animal cartilage and on a human finger support the model predictions. For instance, the estimated difference between the index of refraction of cartilage and water is of only several percent at ∼25 keV mean energy, comparable to that between the linear attenuation coefficients. The potential advantage of DPC imaging thus comes mainly from the edge enhancement at the soft tissue interfaces. Experiments using a cadaveric human finger are also qualitatively consistent with the joint model, showing that refraction contrast is dominated by tendon embedded in muscle, with the cartilage layer difficult to observe in our conditions. Nevertheless, the model predicts that a DPC radiographic system for the small hand joints of the hand could be feasible using a low energy quasi-monochromatic source, such as a K-edge filtered Rh or Mo tube, in conjunction with a ∼2 m long 'symmetric' interferometer operated in a high Talbot order.},

@article{eisner_air_2005,
abstract = {Ice cream is a complex multiphase system consisting of ice crystals, air cells and fat globules embedded in a high viscous freeze concentrated matrix phase. The microstructure of these constituents has significant impact on the consumer quality characteristics and its specific manipulation is of great interest. While in the frozen state the structure is dominated by the ice crystals after thawing the foam characteristics become important. Ice cream foam stability is correlated to the sensed creaminess and can be improved with smaller air cells and reduced coalescence. In contrast to the common approach addressing this goal by changed recipes this contribution proposes an additional process step which allows efficient dispersion of the air cells by high shear forces. Disruption of air cells by shear is efficiently done at high matrix viscosities, which are directly related to the amount of frozen water and therefore the temperature. Conventionally scraped surface heat exchangers (freezers) are used for whipping and freezing of an ice cream premix. With outlet temperature of -5 to -8 C these devices operate at relatively low ice cream viscosities. Here the ice cream is processed in a low temperature extruder \{(LTE)\} after a classic freezer which cools it further to below -12 degrees C. This way shear forces exceeding those in the conventional system by 2-3 orders of magnitude can he applied, The maximum air cell diameter x(90.3) is reduced from 52 to 19 mu m. Beside the air structures the extrusion process induces also changes in the fat structures. High shear forces are also able to form an optimized network of agglomerated fat globules, which further stabilize.,, the foam, These structural changes have a significant impact on the foam related quality characteristics of ice cream its is proven by measurements, of the rheological behaviour during thawing and melt down tests.

Promising results have recently been obtained in materials science and medicine. At the same time, the lack of a mathematical theory comparable with that of conventional CT limits the progress in this field. Such a theory is now suggested, establishing a fundamental relation between the three-dimensional Radon transform of the object function and the two-dimensional Radon transform of the phase-contrast projection. A reconstruction algorithm is derived in the form of a filtered backprojection. The filter function is given in the space and spatial-frequency domains. The theory suggested enables one to quantitatively determine the refractive index of a weakly absorbing medium from x-ray intensity data measured in the near-field region. The results of computer simulations are discussed.},

The results are validated by visual assessments, as well as by quantitative estimation of the image energy loss. The capabilities and the performance of the filter are tested on a number of case studies related to applications in tomographic imaging. The case studies include (i) suppression of waterfall artifacts in electron microscopy images based on focussed ion beam nanotomography, (ii) removal of different types of ring artifacts in synchrotron based X-ray microtomography and (iii) suppression of horizontal stripe artifacts from phase projections in grating interferometry.},

@article{Qi2010,
abstract = {Compared to single energy CT, which only provides information for x-ray linear attenuation coefficients, dual-energy CT is able to obtain both the electron density and effective atomic number for different materials in a quantitative way. In this study, as an alternative to dual-energy CT, a novel quantitative imaging method based on phase contrast CT is presented. Rather than requiring two projection data sets with different x-ray energy spectra, diffraction-grating-based phase contrast CT is capable of reconstructing images of both linear attenuation and refractive index decrement from the same projection data using a single x-ray energy spectra. From the two images, quantitative information of both the electron density and effective atomic number can be extracted. Two physical phantoms were constructed and used to validate the presented method. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) electron density can be accurately determined from refractive index decrement through a linear relationship, and (2) the effective atomic number can be explicitly derived from the ratio of the linear attenuation to refractive index decrement using a power function plus a constant. The presented method will provide insight into the technique of material separation and find its use in medical and industrial applications.},

abstract = {We describe the design and application of a new in-laboratory diffraction-enhanced x-ray imaging (DEXI) instrument that uses a nonsynchrotron, conventional x-ray source to image the internal structure of an object. In the work presented here, a human cadaveric thumb is used as a test-sample to demonstrate the imaging capability of our instrument. A 22 keV monochromatic x-ray beam is prepared using a mismatched, two-crystal monochromator; a silicon analyzer crystal is placed in a parallel crystal geometry with the monochromator allowing both diffraction-enhanced imaging and multiple-imaging radiography to be performed. The DEXI instrument was found to have an experimentally determined spatial resolution of 160+/-7 mum in the horizontal direction and 153+/-7 mum in the vertical direction. As applied to biomedical imaging, the DEXI instrument can detect soft tissues, such as tendons and other connective tissues, that are normally difficult or impossible to image via conventional x-ray techniques.},

The smallest detectable refraction angle is used as a metric for the efficiency in acquiring a differential phase-contrast image. Analytical formulae for the visibility and the smallest detectable refraction angle are derived for Talbot-type and Talbot–Lau-type interferometers, respectively, providing a framework for the optimization of the geometry. The polychromatic performance of a grating interferometer is investigated analytically by calculating the energy-dependent interference fringe visibility, the spectral acceptance and the polychromatic interference fringe visibility. The optimization of grating interferometry is a crucial step for the design of application-specific systems with maximum performance.},

This approach enables to extract information about the phase, the absorption, and the darkfield properties of the x-rayed object. We developed a complete simulation framework for a grating-based interferometer. This Framework incorporates all contributing physical aspects, especially the particle and the wave behaviour of the X-ray photons, realistic noise, and a detailed X-ray source and detector description. Furthermore, we present simulation results and compare them with measurements taken in our lab using a corresponding grating-based interferometer setup. We conclude that the results prove the correctness of our assumptions and simulation framework.}

Slit-scanning differential phase-contrast mammography: first experimental results

abstract = {
The demands for a large field-of-view (FOV) and the stringent requirements for a stable acquisition geometry
rank among the major obstacles for the translation of grating-based, differential phase-contrast techniques
from the laboratory to clinical applications. While for state-of-the-art Full-Field-Digital Mammography
(FFDM) FOVs of 24 cm x 30 cm are common practice, the specifications for mechanical stability are naturally
derived from the detector pixel size which ranges between 50 and 100 μm. However, in grating-based, phasecontrast
imaging, the relative placement of the gratings in the interferometer must be guaranteed to within
micro-meter precision. In this work we report on first experimental results on a phase-contrast x-ray imaging
system based on the Philips MicroDose L30 mammography unit. With the proposed approach we achieve
a FOV of about 65 mm x 175 mm by the use of the slit-scanning technique. The demand for mechanical
stability on a micrometer scale was relaxed by the specific interferometer design, i.e., a rigid, actuator-free
mount of the phase-grating G1 with respect to the analyzer-grating G2 onto a common steel frame. The
image acquisition and formation processes are described and first phase-contrast images of a test object are
presented. A brief discussion of the shortcomings of the current approach is given, including the level of
remaining image artifacts and the relatively inefficient usage of the total available x-ray source output.

The first results on the potential clinical benefits of the technique for X-ray mammography are becoming available and indicate improvements in terms of general image quality, the delineation of lesions versus the background tissue and the visibility of microcalcifications. In this paper, we investigate some aspects related to the technical feasibility of DPCI for human X-ray mammography. After a short introduction to state-of-the-art full-field digital mammography in terms of technical aspects as well as clinical aspects, we put together boundary conditions for DPCI. We then discuss the implications for system design in a comparative manner for systems with two-dimensional detectors versus slit-scanning systems, stating advantages and disadvantages of the two designs. Finally, focusing on a slit-scanning system, we outline a possible concept for phase acquisition.},

For configurations where the sample is placed before the beamsplitter grating, the dark-field contrast has been quantified with theoretical wave propagation models. Yet when the grating is placed before the sample, the dark-field contrast has only been modeled in the geometric optics regime. Here we attempt to quantify the dark-field effect in the grating-before-sample geometry with first-principle wave calculations and understand the associated particle-size selectivity. We obtain an expression for the dark-field effect in terms of the sample material\&\#x2019;s complex refractive index, which can be verified experimentally without fitting parameters. A dark-field computed tomography experiment shows that the particle-size selectivity can be used to differentiate materials of identical x-ray absorption.},

By aligning the gratings on the optical axis of X-rays with a separation that caused the Talbot effect by the first grating, moiré fringes were produced inclining one grating slightly against the other around the optical axis. A phase object placed in front of the first grating was detected by moiré-fringe bending. Using the technique of phase-shifting interferometry, the differential phase corresponding to the phase object could also be measured. This result suggests that X-ray Talbot interferometry is a novel and simple method for phase-sensitive X-ray radiography.},

In this paper, we show that the visibility contrast is even reduced by a uniform sample with flat surfaces due to the so-called \&\#x0201C;beam-hardening effect\&\#x0201D;, which has to be taken into account when X-rays with a continuous spectrum is used.

Imaging also may identify contraindications to LVRS, including bronchiectasis and pleural scarring. The chest X-ray is of limited utility in LVRS evaluation. Chest computed tomography (CT) scanning is an essential component of the evaluation, demonstrating the presence of emphysema and its amount and distribution. Clinical experience has shown that a substantial minority of chest CT scans will also demonstrate pulmonary nodules, some of which represent lung cancers. Published series, including the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, consistently demonstrate that patients with upper lobe predominant or heterogeneous emphysema are most likely to benefit from LVRS. Heterogeneity and distribution can also be assessed by radionuclide ventilation perfusion scanning, but this modality adds little additional information to CT scanning.},

To monitor the morphological changes that the alveoli network undergoes in the progression of these diseases, we propose using the dark-field signal, which is related to small-angle scattering in the sample. Combined with the absorption-based image, the dark-field signal enables better discrimination between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue in a mouse model. All measurements have been performed at 36 keV using a monochromatic laser-driven miniature synchrotron X-ray source (Compact Light Source). In this paper we present grating-based dark-field images of emphysematous vs. healthy lung tissue, where the strong dependence of the dark-field signal on mean alveolar size leads to improved diagnosis of emphysema in lung radiographs.},

  abstract = {Adult bone diseases, especially osteoporosis, lead to increased risk of fracture which in turn is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and financial costs. Clinically, osteoporosis is defined by low bone mineral density; however, increasing evidence suggests that the microarchitectural quality of trabecular bone (TB) is an important determinant of bone strength and fracture risk. Accurate measures of TB thickness and marrow spacing is of significant interest for early diagnosis of osteoporosis or treatment effects. Here, we present a new robust algorithm for computing TB thickness and marrow spacing at a low resolution achievable in vivo. The method uses a star-line tracing technique that effectively deals with partial voluming effects of in vivo imaging with voxel size comparable to TB thickness. Also, the method avoids the problem of digitization associated with conventional algorithms based on sampling distance transform along skeletons. Accuracy of the method was examined using computer-generated phantom images, while the robustness of the method was evaluated on human ankle specimens in terms of stability across a wide range of voxel sizes, repeat scan reproducibility under in vivo conditions, and correlation between thickness values computed at ex vivo and in vivo imaging resolutions. Also, the sensitivity of the method was examined by evaluating its ability to predict the bone strength of cadaveric specimens. Finally, the method was evaluated in a human study involving 40 healthy young-adult volunteers (age: 19-21 years; 20 males and 20 females) and ten athletes (age: 19- 21 years; six males and four females). Across a wide range of voxel sizes, the new method is significantly more accurate and robust as compared to conventional methods. Both TB thickness and marrow spacing measures computed using the new method demonstrated strong associations (R2 ∈ [0.83, 0.87]) with bone streng- h. Also, the TB thickness and marrow spacing measures allowed discrimination between male and female volunteers (p ∈ [0.01, 0.04]) as well as between athletes and nonathletes (p ∈ [0.005, 0.03]).},

  abstract = {Sub-second temporal-resolution tomographic microscopy is becoming a reality at third-generation synchrotron sources. Efficient data handling and post-processing is, however, difficult when the data rates are close to 10GBs${\sp {$-$}1}$. This bottleneck still hinders exploitation of the full potential inherent in the ultrafast acquisition speed. In this paper the fast reconstruction algorithm {\it gridrec}, highly optimized for conventional CPU technology, is presented. It is shown that {\it gridrec} is a valuable alternative to standard filtered back-projection routines, despite being based on the Fourier transform method. In fact, the regridding procedure used for resampling the Fourier space from polar to Cartesian coordinates couples excellent performance with negligible accuracy degradation. The stronger dependence of the observed signal-to-noise ratio for {\it gridrec} reconstructions on the number of angular views makes the presented algorithm even superior to filtered back-projection when the tomographic problem is well sampled. {\it Gridrec} not only guarantees high-quality results but it provides up to 20-fold performance increase, making real-time monitoring of the sub-second acquisition process a reality.},
