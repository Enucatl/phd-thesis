\chapter{Towards quantitative evaluations}
\section{Introduction}
In the previous sections, the results providing the \emph{first light}
through Talbot-Lau interferometers at \SI{160}{\kilo\voltpeak} have been
shown (figures~\ref{fig:img_chip} and~\ref{fig:screw}). It would therefore
be appropriate to test if the quantitative studies on the differential phase
and dark field signals could be replicated and extended to these setups.

A number of studies have been published over the last few years\cn
connecting the intensity of the recorded dark-field signal to physical
properties of a sample, most notably its structure and its composition. A
preliminary study to determine if such a goal would be attainable in the
edge-on and high-energy configuration has been designed.

\section{High efficiency with an edge-on detector}
This consists of the interferometer with a design energy of
\SI{120}{\kilo\eV} (see table~\ref{tab:gratings}) with a specially modified
detector from the detector group of the Paul Scherrer Institute. The
module is a strip detector with 1280 photon counting channels, arranged to
match the fan beam curvature at a distance of \SI{70}{\centi\meter} from the
source. The strips are also designed to lie on the beam plane as to achieve
a maximum efficiency as the full \SI{2}{\centi\meter} thickness of silicon
is used to detect the incoming photons (see
figure~\ref{fig:mythen-edge-on}). The resolution of the detector is
\SI{50}{\micro\meter}.

This large thickness allows to reach a very high efficiency for a silicon
sensor, without compromising the resolution. The calculated efficiency is above
\SI{50}{\percent} up to \SI{160}{\kilo\eV}.}

The new, custom made, detector matching the circular wave front provides a
significant benefit for the visibility of the interference fringes, which is
improved to an average of \SI{7.5}{\percent}, as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:mythen-visibility}.

\subsection{Phase drift for edge-on scans}
The edge-on grating arrangements allows the recording of a line at a time,
with a thickness of about \SI{50}{\micro\meter} at the sample position. This
means that a complete sample scan requires multiple line scans in order to
reconstruct a two-dimensional radiography.

It is a double scan procedure, as the phase stepping procedure is also
carried out to reconstruct the signals generated by the grating
interferometer. In practice, at each position $y$ of the sample, the grating
\G2 is stepped along $z$, after which the $z$ motor of the grating \G2 is
brought back at the starting position. The sample is then moved up along $y$
and a new phase stepping scan is started.

It was observed that this back-and-forth movement of the \G2 motor 
introduces a drift in the differential phase image: if the $z$ motor does
not come back to the exact starting position after each phase stepping scan,
the curve appears to be displaced even when no refraction is actually taking
place.

In order to observe this drift, many consecutive flat scans without sample are performed
and compared to the first scan. The result is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:phase.drift}. The phase differential phase has a constant
drift after each phase stepping scan, but it is possible to correct this
artifact with a simple linear fit. This correction was applied to all
datasets taken with the edge-on interferometer after reconstructing the differential
phase image.

    \caption{Drift of the differential phase signal for consecutive scans as
    a function of the number of scans (left), and on average as a function
of pixel (right). A linear correction can be applied, and it is
approximately constant across the whole field of view.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Testing phase sensitivity}
A quantitative test of the differential phase signal can be performed by
using samples in a shape of a wedge with an an angle $\theta$. Such a sample
introduces a constant deviation in the X-ray beam that can be measured and
then averaged across the whole field of view
(figure~\ref{fig:wedge.deviation}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{gfx/wedge-deviation.png}
    \caption{Deviation of X-rays introduced by a wedge sample with an angle
    $\theta$.}
    \label{fig:wedge.deviation}
\end{figure}

According to equation~\eqref{eq:phase.deviation}, a thickness $z$ of a
homogeneous material with refractive index $\delta$ introduces a change in
the phase of the X-ray beam according to $\phi = -k\delta z$. In the wedge,
the thickness $z$ depends on the position $x$ according to $z = x\tan
\theta$. Equation~\eqref{eq:differential.phase} shows that the grating
interferometer is not actually sensitive to $\phi$ but to its derivative
along the direction $x$, perpendicular to the grating lines. This is the
reason the wedge is an ideal shape for such measurements, since now the
relationship becomes very simply

\begin{align}
    \alpha &= -\frac{1}{k}\partial_x\phi = \delta\tan\theta\\
    \delta &= \frac{2 \pi p_2 \tan \theta}{D_1}P,
    \label{eq:measuring.differential.phase}
\end{align}

where $P$ is the differential phase signal directly as measured with the
interferometer. With this relationship between the real part of the
refractive index $\delta$ and the measured differential phase value $P$ we
can test our experiment by scanning three wedges made of plastic materials
and $\theta = \pi/6$: \ac{PMMA}, \ac{PS} and \ac{HDPE}.
The samples are scanned with an exposure time of \SI{5}{\second} for each of
the \num{9} phase steps.                 

The comparison with the expected values of $\delta$, taken at the average
energy of the spectrum (\SI{50}{\kilo\eV}), and the measured values shows a
good agreement (table~\ref{tab:delta.experiment})

\begin{table}[htb]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{*3c}
        \toprule
        material & $\delta_{\text{NIST}}$ ($\cdot 10^{-9})$ &
        $\delta_{\text{exp}}$ ($\cdot 10^{-9})$ \\
        \midrule
        PMMA & \num{102} & $92 \pm 19$\\
        PS & \num{90} & $81 \pm 21$\\
        HDPE & \num{88} & $87 \pm 14$\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison between values of the real part of the refractive
        index $\delta$ as measured with the \SI{120}{\kilo\eV} Talbot-Lau
        interferometer and taken from the NIST database\cn{NIST}.}
    \label{tab:delta.experiment}
\end{table}

\subsection{Testing dark field sensitivity to microstructures}
It has been reported in many studies that the dark field contrast arises
whenever the sample contains very small structures, on the scale of few
micrometers, that cannot be resolved by a detector pixel, but contribute to
decreasing the visibility of the interference pattern in a Talbot-Lau
interferometer.

In order to reproduce this phenomenon, rectangular plastic blocks filled
with different substances are scanned under different angles in the
interferometer. This allows to record images for different thicknesses of
the same material by only changing the rotation angle, with \num{9} phase
steps and \SI{5}{\second} exposure per step.

The images are segmented so that the region containing the material, that is
with the most absorption, is selected. More in detail, the minimum value in
the transmission profile is selected, and values up to
\SI{10}{\percent} higher than the minimum are kept.

The data are then averaged, and shown here with $R = \log(B) / \log(A)$ as
function of X-ray transmission, indicating different thicknesses
(figure~\ref{fig:powders}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gfx/powders-aggregated.png}
    \caption{Ratio $R = \log(B) / \log(A)$ as a function of sample
    thickness, indicated by X-ray transmission, for different materials.}
    \label{fig:powders}
\end{figure}

Another interesting sample is a metal rod embedded in a polystyrene foam.
Foams are another class of samples that are particularly relevant for
dark-field imaging, providing enhanced contrast from the small air bubbles
in a matrix.

    \caption{A steel rod embedded in a polystyrene foam, scanned with \num{9} phase
steps and \SI{5}{\second} exposure per step. The sample is sketched on the
left and the profile of the image is plotted on the right. The foam has a larger contrast
in the dark-field image, while the homogeneous steel bar has a larger
contrast in the transmission image.}
\end{figure}

The results at this stage are mainly qualitative in nature, as the samples
are very heterogeneous and contain particles of different sizes, but suggest
that powders have a stronger dark field signal than homogeneous samples,
thus indicating that further investigations, presented in
chapter~\ref{ch:lung-dark-field}, should be carried out to determine a more
precise model.
