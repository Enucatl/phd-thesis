\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
It is actually impossible to mention the countless contributions involved in
the unfolding of such a long project.

I would like to express my gratitude
to Prof. Marco Stampanoni, my research
supervisor, for the generous help during the complex development
of this research work. The small daily collaborations with all the TOMCAT
group members during the years have been invaluable in the daily operation
of all the experiments. I am particularly grateful for the assistance given
by Gordan Mikuljan.
Special thanks also go to Thomas Th\"uring, Matias Kagias, Maria B\"uchner,
Spyros Gkoumas and Goran Lovri\'c, for their academic and personal help
throughout all of my work.

Finally, I would like to thank all of my friends --- I can name here only a
few: Massimo Secci, Stefano Spigler, Alessio Rocca, Stefano Marras, Luigi
Riondino, Art\`u Breuer, Roberto Casotto, Daniele Schiavi --- for their
efforts in making me a better person.
